        "description": "A checksum is an algorithm that scans a packet of data and returns a single number. The idea is that if the packet is changed, the checksum will also change, so checksums are often used for detecting\ntransmission errors, validating document contents, and in many other situations where it is necessary to detect undesirable changes in data.\n\nFor this problem, you will implement a checksum algorithm called Quicksum. A Quicksum packet allows only uppercase letters and spaces. It always begins and ends with an uppercase letter. \n\nOtherwise, spaces and uppercase letters can occur in any combination, including consecutive spaces.\n\nA Quicksum is the sum of the products of each character\u2019s position in the packet times the character\u2019s value. A space has a value of zero, while letters have a value equal to their position in the alphabet. \n\nSo, `A = 1`, `B = 2`, etc., through `Z = 26`. Here are example Quicksum calculations for the packets `\"ACM\"` and `\"A C M\"`:\n```\nACM\n1 \u00d7 1 + 2 \u00d7 3 + 3 \u00d7 13 = 46 \n\nA C M\n1 x 1 + 3 x 3 + 5 * 13 = 75\n```\n\nWhen the packet doesn't have only uppercase letters and spaces or just spaces the result to quicksum have to be zero (0).\n```\nAbqTH #5 = 0\n```",

Well, let's print it!\n\n```\n   H        1\n     e      2\n      l     3\n      l     4\n     o      5\n            6\n W          7\no           8\nr           9\n l         10\n   d        1\n     !      2\n\n3210123\n```\n\n(Obviously, the numbers are only shown above to demonstrate `amp` and `period`)\n\nHappy coding!\n\n*Note:* due to the inevitable use of floats, solutions with slight rounding errors (1 space difference in less than 10% of the output lines) will be accepted.\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/collections/katas-created-by-anter69)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",

        "description": "Create a function that interprets code in the esoteric language **Poohbear**\n\n## The Language\n\nPoohbear is a stack-based language largely inspired by Brainfuck. It has a maximum integer value of 255, and 30,000 cells. The original intention of Poohbear was to be able to send messages that would, to most, be completely indecipherable: \n<a href=https://esolangs.org/wiki/Poohbear>Poohbear Wiki</a>\n\n* For the purposes of this kata, you will make a version of Poohbear that has **infinite** memory cells in **both directions** (so you do not need to limit cells to 30,000)\n* Cells have a default value of 0\n* Each cell can hold one byte of data.  Once a cell's value goes above 255, it wraps around to 0.  If a cell's value goes below 0, it wraps to 255.\n* If the result of an operation isn't an int, round the result down to the nearest one.\n* Your interpreter should ignore any non-command characters in the code.\n* If you come to a `W` in the code and the current cell is equal to 0, jump to the corresponding `E`.\n* If you come to an `E` in the code and the current cell is **not** 0, jump back to the corresponding `W`.\n\nHere are the Poohbear commands: \n\n| Command | Definition\n|---| -------------------------\n| + | Add 1 to the current cell\n| - | Subtract 1 from the current cell\n| > | Move the cell pointer 1 space to the right\n| < | Move the cell pointer 1 space to the left\n| c | \"Copy\" the current cell\n| p | Paste the \"copied\" cell into the current cell\n| W | While loop - While the current cell is not equal to 0\n| E | Closing character for loops\n| P | Output the current cell's value as ascii\n| N | Output the current cell's value as an integer\n| T | Multiply the current cell by 2\n| Q | Square the current cell\n| U | Square root the current cell's value\n| L | Add 2 to the current cell\n| I | Subtract 2 from the current cell\n| V | Divide the current cell by 2\n| A | Add the copied value to the current cell's value\n| B | Subtract the copied value from the current cell's value\n| Y | Multiply the current cell's value by the copied value\n| D | Divide the current cell's value by the copied value.",

        "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:<br/>\nS(1) = 1<br/>\nS(2) = 3<br/>\nS(3) = 5<br/>\nS(4) = 8<br/>\nS(5) = 10<br/>\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: <br/>\n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one. Can you imagine that all the solutions to inequality mn <= k can be split using sqrt(k) as pivotal item? \n\n",

The way `map` works is that it accepts two arguments: the first one is a function, the second one is an array, a tuple, or a string. It goes through the array, applying the function to each element of an array and storing the result in a new array. The new array is the result of the `map` function. You may read more on the `map` function [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#map).\n\nYou should return a list (python 2 style) instead of a generator (python 3).\n\n*Note:* as Python already has a built-in `map` function, that is disabled.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nmap(sum, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])  ==>  [6, 9, 21]\n\nmap(str, [1, 2, 3])  ==>  ['1', '2', '3']\n\nmap(int, ['34', '23'])  ==>  [34, 23]\n\n```",

        "description": "# Introduction\n\nThe Condi (Consecutive Digraphs) cipher was introduced by G4EGG (Wilfred Higginson) in 2011. The cipher preserves word divisions, and is simple to describe and encode, but it's surprisingly difficult to crack. \n\n# Encoding Algorithm\n\nThe encoding steps are:\n- Start with an `initial key`, e.g. `cryptogram`\n- Form a `key`, remove the key duplicated letters except for the first occurrence\n- Append to it, in alphabetical order all letters which do not occur in the `key`.  \n  The example produces: `cryptogambdefhijklnqsuvwxz`\n- Number the `key alphabet` starting with 1.\n```python\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13\nc  r  y  p  t  o  g  a  m  b  d  e  f \n14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\nh  i  j  k  l  n  q  s  u  v  w  x  z\n```\n- One of the inputs to encoding algorithm is an `initial shift`, say `10`\n- Encode the first letter of your `message` by moving 10 places to the right from the letter's position in the key alphabet. If the first letter were say `o` then the letter 10 places to the right in the `key alphabet` is `j`, so `o` would be encoded as `j`. If you move past the end of the key alphabet you wrap back to the beginning. For example if the first letter were `s` then counting 10 places would bring you around to `t`.\n- Use the position of the previous plaintext letter as the number of places to move to encode the next plaintext number. If you have just encoded an `o` (position 6) , and you now want to encode say `n`, then you move 6 places to the right from `n` which brings you to `x`.\n- Keep repeating the previous step until all letters are encoded.\n\nDecoding is the reverse of encoding - you move to the left instead of to the right.\n\n# Task\n\nCreate two functions - `encode`/`Encode` and `decode`/`Decode` which implement Condi cipher encoding and decoding.\n\n# Inputs\n\n- `message` - a string to encode/decode\n- `key` - a key consists of only lower case letters\n- `initShift` - a non-negative integer representing the initial shift\n\n# Notes\n- Don't forget to remove the duplicated letters from the `key` except for the first occurrence \n- Characters which do not exist in the `key alphabet` should be coppied to the output string exactly like they appear in the `message` string\n- Check the test cases for samples",

Now, `12/6 = 2`.\n* The divisors of `28` are `1, 2, 4, 7, 14 & 28` and their sum is `56`. Now, `56/28 = 2`.\n* The divisors of `496` are `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248, 496` and their sum is `992`. Now, `992/496 = 2`.\n\nWe shall say that `(6,28,496)` is a grouping with a ratio of `2`.  \n\nSimilarly, consider the grouping `(30,140)`: \n* The divisors of `30` are: `1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 & 30` and their sum is `72`. Now, `72/30 = 12/5 = 2.4`.\n* The divisors of `140` are `1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 70, 140` and their sum is `336`. Now, `336/140 = 12/5 = 2.4`.\n\nWe shall say that `(30,140)` is a grouping with a ratio of `12/5`. \n\n`(6,28)` and `(30,140)` are the only groupings in which `every member of a group is 0 <= n < 200`. The sum of the smallest members of each group is `6 + 30 = 36`. \n\nGiven a `range(a,b),` return the sum of the smallest members of each group. As illustrated above:\n* every member of a group must be greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`. \n* a group must have `2` or more members. \n\n```\nExamples:\nsolve(1,200) = 36, the sum of [6,30] as explained above\nsolve(1,250) = 168, the sum of [6, 12, 30, 40, 80]\nsolve(1,500) = 498, the sum of [6, 12, 30, 40, 66, 78, 80, 84, 102]\n\nAs you can see, for \"solve(1,500)\", we do not include all (6,28) & (6,496) & (28,496). We count the group once by including 6 only.\n```\n\nIf there are no groups, return `0`. Upper limit is `2000`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nif you like this Kata, please try:\n\n[Simple division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ec2d112332430ce9000005)\n\n[Sub-array division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59eb64cba954273cd4000099)",

(CEO) Nut Co.*\n</span>\n\nBarely able to contain your excitement you jump in the car and head straight back to the Nut Farm.\n\n# To Recap\n\nHarvesting nuts is very easy. We just shake the trees and the nuts fall out!\n\nAs they fall down the nuts might hit branches:\n\n* Sometimes they bounce left.\n* Sometimes they bounce right.\n* Sometimes they get stuck in the tree and don't fall out at all.\n\n## Legend\n\n* `o` = a nut\n* `\\` = branch. A nut hitting this branch bounces right\n* `/` = branch. A nut hitting this branch bounces left\n* `.` = leaves, which have no effect on falling nuts\n* `|` = tree trunk, which has no effect on falling nuts\n* ` ` = empty space, which has no effect on falling nuts\n\n\n# Kata Task\n\nShake the tree and count where the nuts land.\n\n**Output** - An array (same width as the tree) which indicates how many nuts fell at each position ^\n\n^ See the example tests\n\nNotes\n\n* The nuts may be anywhere in the canopy of the tree\n* Nuts do not affect the falling patterns of other nuts\n* Falling nuts are only affected by the branches **beneath** them\n* There is not always space for nuts to fall between branches\n* A left/right bouncing nut may continue hitting other branches that bounces it further in that direction\n* If a nut bouncing in one direction bounces backwards then it will become stuck in the tree\n* There are no branches at the extreme left/right edges of the tree so it is not possible for a nut to fall \"out of bounds\"\n\n# Example\n\n\n<pre style='font-size:20px;line-height:22px;'>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>o//<span style='background:green'>.</span>o<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\\o<span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>/\\\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>///<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>o\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>oo<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>o/\\<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\\\\o/<span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>o<span style='background:green'>.</span>o\\\\//<span style='background:green'>.</span>o/<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\/<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\/<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>o\\oo\\o<span style='background:green'>.</span>oo<span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>/<span style='background:green'>.</span>/<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>//o<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>o<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>oo\\o<span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>o\\oo/\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>o<span style='background:green'>.</span>o<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>\n<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span>\\<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>o/oo\\<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>//<span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span><span style='background:green'>.</span>\n        <span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span>\n        <span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span>\n        <span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span>\n        <span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span><span style='background:brown'> </span>    \n0000112013052200106\n</pre>",

Write a function `getTimeText(hour, minute)` (or `get_time_text(cls, h, m)` for Python) that takes the time as two integers and returns the spelled out time as written below.\n\nWe would like the text to be simple to read, so we will round the current time to the next full 5 minutes (Definitely more convenient for the user than rounding down...). We will use a 12-hour clock (e.g. 13:00 is \"one\". For this particular clock we will not use \"AM\" and \"PM\", just the time (and let the user guess which half of the day it is ;-) )\n\nThe time will be passed in a 24-hour format, and may contain `(0, 0)` as well as `(24, 0)`.\n\n# Examples\n\n| Time  | Expected String        |\n| ---   | ---                    |\n| 00:00 | \"midnight\"             |\n| 12:01 | \"five past noon\"       |\n| 01:05 | \"five past one\"        |\n| 13:06 | \"ten past one\"         |\n| 16:29 | \"half past four\"       |\n| 22:34 | \"twenty-five to eleven\"|\n| 06:44 | \"quarter to seven\"     |\n| 07:56 | \"eight\"                |\n\n# English time representation\n\nAs a reminder for all who are not that familiar with english names for the time:\n\nDuring the first 30 minutes of an hour (_m_ < 30), the time is measured from the current hour (_m_ past _h_), afterwards we measure to the next hour (_60-m_ to _h_). 00:00 is called midnight, 12:00 is called noon.\n\nHour names:\n\n| Hour  | Name     |\n| ---   | ---      |\n| 00:00 | midnight |\n| 01:00 | one      |\n| 02:00 | two      |\n| ...   | ...      |\n| 12:00 | noon     |\n| 13:00 | one      |\n| 14:00 | two      |\n| ...   | ...      |\n| 24:00 | midnight |\n\nMinute names:\n\n| Minute | Name        |\n| ---    | ---         |\n| xx:00  | -           |\n| xx:05  | five        |\n| xx:10  | ten         |\n| xx:15  | *quarter*   |\n| xx:20  | twenty      |\n| xx:25  | twenty-five |\n| xx:30  | *half*      |\n",

        "description": "Consider the range `0` to `10`. The primes in this range are: `2, 3, 5, 7`, and thus the prime pairs are: `(2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (2,7), (3,3), (3,5), (3,7),(5,5), (5,7), (7,7)`.\n\nLet's take one pair `(2,7)` as an example and get the product, then sum the digits of the result as follows:  `2 * 7 = 14`, and `1 + 4 = 5`. We see that `5` is a prime number. Similarly, for the pair `(7,7)`, we get: `7 * 7 = 49`, and `4 + 9 = 13`, which is a prime number. \n\nYou will be given a range and your task is to return the number of pairs that revert to prime as shown above. In the range `(0,10)`, there are only `4` prime pairs that end up being primes in a similar way: `(2,7), (3,7), (5,5), (7,7)`. Therefore, `solve(0,10) = 4)`\n\nNote that the upperbound of the range will not exceed `10000`. A range of `(0,10)` means that: `0 <= n < 10`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try \n\n[Simple Prime Streaming](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a908da30025e995880000e3)\n\n[Prime reduction](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59aa6567485a4d03ff0000ca)\n\n[Dominant primes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ce11ea9f0cbc8a390000ed)",

        "description": "### Different lists?\n\nHere are two lists. They each represent a sample of observations of some value taken from some larger population of values:\n\n```python\ng1 = [124, 118, 78, 123, 124, 124]\ng2 = [127, 125, 125, 125, 172, 125]\n```\n```r\ng1 <- c(124, 118, 78, 123, 124, 124)\ng2 <- c(127, 125, 125, 125, 172, 125)\n```\n\nDid these come from the same population? It's hard to say. We don't know what they are. Maybe the number of people enrolled in an introductory statistics class? Maybe systolic blood pressure measurements? Maybe my golf scores?\n\n### Some things to notice\n\nYou'll notice the smallest value in g2 is larger than the biggest in g1, but the variance of each sample is pretty big, so again, it's hard to say.  Let's focus on the mean values: the mean of g1 is about `117.17`, for g2 it's `136.5`, and the absolute difference is about `19.33`. \n\n\n### Don't do it this way\nWe could compute a two-sided t-test on the sample means, but we'd be out on a limb with that one, since, again, we can't say anything about the distribution of the values in the population they come from. Lets do that (**DON'T DO THAT**): assuming equal variances (they're about equal), we get a p-value of `0.1265`. So they look a little different, but really not that different, and not different enough to satisfy the good folks at Guinness in 1908.\n\n### Do it this way\nLets try this: if they are from the same population, i.e., _if the measurement is independent of the group assignment_, then we can assign measurement values to whichever group we'd like. It's like probability with counting. We can partition the 12 measurements above, 6 in group g1 and 6 in g2, in all the different ways possible, and then _count how many times the sample statistic (absolute difference between sample means) is equal or greater than the sample statistic (absolute difference between sample means) in observation we were given to begin with_.  This is what is known as a [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_%28statistics%29#Permutation_tests).  Do that. Make it exact.\n\n\n# Task:\nWrite a function, `exact_p(g1, g2)` that takes two samples g1 and g2, and computes a p-value for the difference in sample means using a permutation test.  \n\n#### Some things to remember:\n1.  Given all possible partitions of the data into equal size groups, `p` is the proportion of those partitions with an ABSOLUTE difference in sample means EQUAL or GREATER than the original partition. \n2.  As implied by item 1, `0 < p < 1`\n3.  As with the example, samples g1 and g2 will always have the same length, have non-overlapping ranges, and you can assume equal variances.\n4.  Your function will be tested with samples of length 2 to 9 (no empty lists, no lists of length 1) \n5.  Results are rounded to 4 decimal places when tested, so I suppose you have a chance with a Monte Carlo approach. \n\n# Examples\n\n```python\nexact_p([124, 118, 78, 123, 124, 124], [127, 125, 125, 125, 172, 125]) => 0.0021645021645021645\nexact_p([12705, 12264, 12003, 12536], [13524, 13478, 12845, 13351])    => 0.02857142857142857\n```\n```r\nexact_p(c(124, 118, 78, 123, 124, 124), c(127, 125, 125, 125, 172, 125))\n[1] 0.002164502\nexact_p(c(12705, 12264, 12003, 12536), c(13524, 13478, 12845, 13351))\n[1] 0.02857143\n```\n\nNote: rounding the result may result in some random tests expecting a value of 0. That doesn't mean it expects your p value to be 0, it just expects it to be less than 0.00005.  The p value of an exact permutation test can never be 0. Understanding that will help you solve this kata!\n\n\nIf you want to try finding an exact p for two groups with overlapping ranges, try this one [Exact p](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59baf6676a9b6053950007b1) \n\n",

Sounds cute and fuzzy to me.</i>\n<br><br>- Jonas Quinn and Jack O'Neill, \"Paradise Lost\".</blockquote>\n\n<br>\n<h1>Previously on Stargate SG-1</h1>\n\nArriving on P4F-976, SG-1 finally come into contact with the <i>Furlings</i>, one of the four great races within the Milky Way. After several days of deliberation with the Furling Directorate, the Tauri finally have access to the knowledge they have been searching for. \n\nThe Furlings, having provided assistance with the Ancient's expansion into the Milky Way, have extensive knowledge of the Stargate Network and it's components. One such component, the Dial Home Device, has caused many disasters at Stargate Command through it's absence. Thankfully, the Furlings have all the necessary blueprints for it's construction, and have handed copies over to the Tauri. After beginning mass production of the control crystals necessary for it's function, Stargate Command has hit a snag. The Ancients had designed the control crystals to function if their inner pathways are as efficient as possible - essentially, the pathways must choose the shortest path between two nodes. Stargate Command has turned to you - a software engineer - to fix their problems.\n\n<br>\n<h1>Your Mission</h1>\n\nGiven a string containing the current state of the control crystals inner pathways (labeled as `\"X\"`) and its gaps (labeled as `\".\"`), generate the shortest path from the start node (labeled as `\"S\"`) to the goal node (labeled as `\"G\"`) and return the new pathway (labeled with `\"P\"` characters).<br>If no solution is possible, return the string `\"Oh for crying out loud...\"` (in frustration).\n\n<br>\n<h1>The Rules</h1>\n\n- Nodes labeled as `\"X\"` are not traversable.\n- Nodes labeled as `\".\"` are traversable.\n- A pathway can be grown in eight directions (up, down, left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right), so diagonals are possible.\n- Nodes labeled `\"S\"` and `\"G\"` are not to be replaced with `\"P\"` in the case of a solution.\n- The shortest path is defined as the path with the shortest euclidiean distance going from one node to the next.\n- If several paths are possible with the same shortest distance, return any one of them.\n\nNote that the mazes won't always be squares.\n\n<br>\n<b>Example #1: Valid solution</b>\n\n```\n.S...             .SP..\nXXX..             XXXP.\n.X.XX      =>     .XPXX\n..X..             .PX..\nG...X             G...X\n```\n\n<br>\n<b>Example #2: No solution</b>\n\n```\nS....      \nXX...      \n...XX      =>     \"Oh for crying out loud...\"\n.XXX.      \nXX..G\n```\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\nNote: Your solution will have to be efficient because it will have to deal with a lot of maps and big ones.\n\nCaracteristics of the random tests:\n\n* map sizes from 3x3 to 73x73 (step is 5 from one size to the other, mazes won't always be squares)\n* 20 random maps for each size.\n* Overall, 311 tests to pass with the fixed ones.",

        "description": "In this Kata you are a detective!\n\nYour job is to understand if the possible solution of a murder is true or false, the only problem is that all the information that you have about the murder are in form of a logical expression.\n\nExample:\nQuestion - is it possible that:\n\n```(1) The butler is innocent.```\n```(2) If the butler is innocent the murder was done outside of the kitchen.```\n```(3) The murder was done at midnight and in the kitchen.```\n\n\nBut to you are given only logical informations:\n\n ```(b)AND(!bOR!k)AND(n)AND(k)```\n \nwhere:\n\n``` b = the butler is innocent```\n\n``` k = the murder was done in the kitchen```\n\n``` n = the murder was done at midnight```\n\nYou can see that with k and n both = true, the poor butler can't be innocent. Why? Because if k is true and b is true then !bOR!k can't be true -> the logical expression is false.\n\nYou need to write a method that take in input a String that contains a logical expression and then must return a boolean value; the method need to evaluate the logic expression and return false if the expression can't be true and true otherwise.\n\nThe logic expression is always in the form with OR inside parentheses and AND outside, all the logical predicates are in lowercase (so there is a maximum of predicates) and inside parentheses. there aren't spaces or other characters except for exclamation point (that means not), parentheses and letters\n\nSame examples:\n\n``` (p) ``` is OK\n\n``` (P) ``` is NOT OK because P is not in lowercase\n\n``` (pOR!q)AND(z) ``` is OK\n\n``` (p)OR(z) ``` is NOT OK because the OR is outside parentheses\n\n``` p ``` is NOT OK because p is outside parentheses\n\n``` ((a)AND(b)ORc) ``` is NOT OK because parentheses can't be inside other parentheses\n\nHINT: Use the structure of the logical expression to your advantage, it is in the right shape to facilitate the resolution of the problem!\n\nHINT2: You can check the Davis-Putnam algorithm for an input to resolve this Kata, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis%E2%80%93Putnam_algorithm\">Wikipedia link</a>.",

        "description": "GET TO THE CHOPPA! DO IT NOW!\n\nFor this kata you must create a function that will find the shortest possible path between two nodes in a 2D grid of nodes.\n\nDetails:\n\n* Your function will take three arguments: a grid of nodes, a start node, and an end node. Your function will return a list of nodes that represent, in order, the path that one must follow to get from the start node to the end node. The path must begin with the start node and end with the end node. No single node should be repeated in the path (ie. no backtracking).\n\n````if:python\n```python\ndef find_shortest_path(grid, start_node, end_node):\n    pass\n```\n````\n````if:haskell\n```haskell\nshortestPath :: Grid -> Pos -> Pos -> Path\n```\n````\n* The grid is a list of lists of nodes. Each node object has a position that indicates where in the grid the node is (it's indices).\n\n````if:python\n```python\nnode.position.x  # 2\nnode.position.y  # 5\nnode.position  # (2,5)\nnode is grid[2][5]  # True\n```\n````\n````if:haskell\n```haskell\n-- The following types are defined in Haskell :\ntype Pos = (Int,Int)\ndata Node = Passable | NotPassable\n-- A grid is a list of list of nodes, which are Passable / NotPassable\ntype Grid = [[Node]]\ntype Path = [Pos]\n```\n````\n* Each node may or may not be 'passable'. All nodes in a path must be passable. A node that is not passable is effectively a wall that the shortest path must go around.\n\n````if:python\n```python\na_node.passable  # True\n```\n````\n````if:haskell\n```haskell\n(grid !! y !! x) == Passable -- True\n```\n````\n* Diagonal traversals between nodes are NOT allowed in this kata. Your path must move in one of 4 directions at any given step along the path: left, right, up, or down.\n* Grids will always be rectangular (NxM), but they may or may not be square (NxN).\n* Your function must return a shortest path for grid widths and heights ranging between 0 and 200. This includes 0x0 and 200x200 grids.\n* 0x0 grids should return an empty path list\n* When more than one shortest path exists (different paths, all viable, with the same number of steps) then any one of these paths will be considered a correct answer.\n* Your function must be efficient enough (in terms of time complexity) to pass all the included tests within the allowed timeframe (6 seconds).\n\n````if:python\n* In python, for your convenience, a `print_grid` function exists that you can use to print a grid. You can also use `print_grid` to visualize a given path on the given grid. The print_grid function has the following signature:\n\n```python\ndef print_grid(grid, start_node=None, end_node=None, path=None)\n# output without a path\n\"\"\"\nS0110\n01000\n01010\n00010\n0001E\n\"\"\"\n\n# output with a path\n\"\"\"\nS0110\n#1###\n#1#1#\n###1#\n0001E\n\"\"\"\n```\n````\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "To give credit where credit is due: This problem was taken from the ACMICPC-Northwest Regional Programming Contest. Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\nComplete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~",

But consider the rule...\n\nBy the way you don't have to check errors or incorrect input values, everything is ok without bad tricks, only two input strings and as result one output string;-)...\n\n<u>And here's the rule:</u>  \nInput Strings `a` and `b`: For every character in string `a` swap the casing of every occurrence of the same character in string `b`. Then do the same casing swap with the inputs reversed. Return a single string consisting of the changed version of `a` followed by the changed version of `b`. A char of `a` is in `b` regardless if it's in upper or lower case - see the testcases too.  \nI think that's all;-)...\n\nSome easy examples:\n\n````\nInput: \"abc\" and \"cde\"      => Output: \"abCCde\" \nInput: \"ab\" and \"aba\"       => Output: \"aBABA\"\nInput: \"abab\" and \"bababa\"  => Output: \"ABABbababa\"\n````\n\nOnce again for the last example - description from `KenKamau`, see discourse;-):\n\na) swap the case of characters in string `b` for every occurrence of that character in string `a`  \nchar `'a'` occurs twice in string `a`, so we swap all `'a'` in string `b` twice. This means we start with `\"bababa\"` then `\"bAbAbA\"` => `\"bababa\"`  \nchar `'b'` occurs twice in string `a` and so string `b` moves as follows: start with `\"bababa\"` then `\"BaBaBa\"` => `\"bababa\"`\n\nb) then, swap the case of characters in string `a` for every occurrence in string `b`  \nchar `'a'` occurs `3` times in string `b`. So string `a` swaps cases as follows: start with `\"abab\"` then => `\"AbAb\"` => `\"abab\"` => `\"AbAb\"`  \nchar `'b'` occurs `3` times in string `b`. So string `a` swaps as follow: start with `\"AbAb\"` then => `\"ABAB\"` => `\"AbAb\"` => `\"ABAB\"`.\n\nc) merge new strings `a` and `b`  \nreturn `\"ABABbababa\"`\n\nThere are some static tests at the beginning and many random tests if you submit your solution.\n\n<h2><font color=\"red\">Hope you have fun:-)!</font></h2>",

But don't use `Decimal`: if you use it, your code won't pass the performance tests).\n* Any strings that aren't numbers and aren't in the index column should be overwritten with a \"-\".\n* Your returned array should be in alphabetical order according to the values you pivoted on.\n* Since database manipulations turn often in manipulations of big data, your code will have to be fast enough to handle some tests with arrays of 1 300 000 lines without timing out (several approaches are still possible in terms of time complexity, though be clever about what you choose to implement). \n\n</br>\n\n\n\nGood luck!",

If n is less than 0 it should rotate the array to the left.\nIf n is 0, then it should return the array unchanged.\n\nExample:\n```\nwith array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn = 1\t  =>\t[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nn = 2\t  =>\t[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\nn = 3\t  =>\t[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]\nn = 4\t  =>\t[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\nn = 5\t  =>\t[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nn = 0\t  =>\t[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nn = -1     =>\t[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\nn = -2\t =>\t[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]\nn = -3\t =>\t[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\nn = -4\t =>\t[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nn = -5\t =>\t[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThe rotation shouldn't be limited by the indices available in the array. Meaning that if we exceed the indices of the array it keeps rotating.\n\nExample:\n```\nwith array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn = 7\t    =>\t[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\nn = 11 \t  =>\t[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nn = 12478\t=>\t[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]\n```",

        "description": "###Introduction\n\nThe [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) (Yijing, or Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese book of sixty-four hexagrams. \nA hexagram is a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines, where each line is either Yang (an unbroken line) or Yin (a broken line):\n```\n---------    ---- ----    ---------    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n---------    ---- ----    ---- ----    \n---------    ---------    ---- ----    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n```\nThe book is commonly used as an oracle. After asking it a question about one's present scenario,\neach line is determined by random methods to be Yang or Yin. The resulting hexagram is then interpreted by the querent as a symbol of their current situation, and how it might unfold.\n\nThis kata will consult the I Ching using the three coin method.\n\n###Instructions\n\nA coin is flipped three times and lands heads\nor tails. The three results are used to\ndetermine a line as being either:\n```\n3 tails          ----x----  Yin (Moving Line*)\n2 tails 1 heads  ---------  Yang\n1 tails 2 heads  ---- ----  Yin \n3 heads          ----o----  Yang (Moving Line*)\n\n*See bottom of description if curious.\n```\nThis process is repeated six times to determine\neach line of the hexagram. The results of these\noperations are then stored in a 2D Array like so:\n```javascript\n[['two','h','h','t'],['six','t','h','t'],['four','t','t','t'],\n['one','h','t','h'],['three','h','h','h'],['five','t','t','h']]\n```\nIn each array the first index will always be the number of the line ('one' is the bottom line, and 'six' the top), and the other three values will be the results of the coin flips that belong to that line as heads ('h') and tails ('t').\n\nWrite a function that will take a 2D Array like the above as argument and return its hexagram as a string. Each line of the hexagram should begin on a new line.\n\n```javascript\noracle([['two','h','h','t'],['six','t','h','t'],['four','t','t','t'], \n['one','h','t','h'],['three','h','h','h'],['five','t','t','h']]);\n```\nshould return:\n```\n---------\n---------\n----x----\n----o----\n---- ----\n---- ----\n```\nYou are welcome to consult your new oracle program with a question before pressing submit. You can compare your result [here](http://www.ichingfortune.com/hexagrams.php). The last test case is random and can be used for your query.\n\n*[1] A Moving Line is a Yang line that will change\nto Yin or vice versa. The hexagram made by the coin\nthrows represents the querent's current situation,\nand the hexagram that results from changing its\nmoving lines represents their upcoming situation.*",

The solution above would be encoded as:\n\n```\n [\n  ['ABCD', 'EFGH', 'IJKL', 'MNOP', 'QRST'],\n  ['AEIM', 'BJOQ', 'CHNT', 'DGLS', 'FKPR'],\n  ['AGKO', 'BIPT', 'CFMS', 'DHJR', 'ELNQ'],\n  ['AHLP', 'BKNS', 'CEOR', 'DFIQ', 'GJMT'],\n  ['AFJN', 'BLMR', 'CGPQ', 'DEKT', 'HIOS']\n ]\n```\n\nYou need to make sure (1) that each golfer plays exactly once every day, (2) that the number and size of the groups is the same every day, and (3) that each player plays with every other player *at most* once.\n\nSo although each player must play every day, there can be particular pairs of players that never play together.\n\nIt is not necessary to consider the case where the number of golfers is zero; no tests will check for that. If you do wish to consider that case, note that you should accept as valid all possible solutions for zero golfers, who (vacuously) can indeed play in an unlimited number of groups of zero.\n",

We need the help of maths, in this case of number theory.\n\nWe need to apply the prime factorization of a number:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/KYanmyW\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KYanmyW.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThink in doing the prime factorization of the product of all the different values of the array and think how to obtain from it the minimum number that is divisible by all the values of the array.\n\nSee the same cases as the previous part:\n\n```python\nmin_special_mult([2, 3 ,4 ,5, 6, 7]) == 420\n```\nThe array may have integers that occurs more than once:\n```python\nmin_special_mult([18, 22, 4, 3, 21, 6, 3]) == 2772\n```\nThe array should have all its elements integer values. If the function finds an invalid entry (or invalid entries) like strings of the alphabet or symbols will not do the calculation and will compute and register them, outputting a message in singular or plural, depending on the number of invalid entries.\n\n```python\nmin_special_mult([16, 15, 23, 'a', '&', '12']) == \"There are 2 invalid entries: ['a', '&']\"\n\nmin_special_mult([16, 15, 23, 'a', '&', '12', 'a']) == \"There are 3 invalid entries: ['a', '&', 'a']\"\n\nmin_special_mult([16, 15, 23, 'a', '12']) == \"There is 1 invalid entry: a\"\n```\nIf the string is a valid number, the function will convert it as an integer.\n```python\nmin_special_mult([16, 15, 23, '12']) == 5520\n\nmin_special_mult([16, 15, 23, '012']) == 5520\n```\nAll the None elements of the array will be ignored:\n```python\nmin_special_mult([18, 22, 4, , None, 3, 21, 6, 3]) == 2772\n```\nIf the array has a negative number, the function will convert to a positive one.\n```python\nmin_special_mult([18, 22, 4, , None, 3, -21, 6, 3]) == 2772\n\nmin_special_mult([16, 15, 23, '-012']) == 5520\n```\n\nThe test for this part will be more challenging having arrays up to 5000 elements and up to 800 different values.\n\nA simple brute force algorithm will not be able to pass the tests.\nEnjoy it!\n\n\n",

Your task is to write three functions that work similarly to Excel's COUNTIF, SUMIF and AVERAGEIF functions.\n\n##Specifications\nEach function will take the same two arguments:\n\n* A list object containing `values` to be counted, summed, or averaged.\n* A `criteria` in either an integer, float, or string\n    * Integer or float indicates equality\n    * Strings can indicate >, >=, <, <= or <> (use the Excel-style \"Not equal to\" operator) to a number (ex. \">=3\"). In the `count_if` function, a string without an operater indicates equality to this string.\n    \nThe tests will all include properly formatted inputs. The test cases all avoid rounding issues associated with floats.\n\n##Examples\n ```python\ncount_if([1,3,5,7,9], 3)\n1\n\ncount_if([\"John\",\"Steve\",\"John\"], \"John\")\n2\n\nsum_if([2,4,6,-1,3,1.5],\">0\")\n16.5\n\naverage_if([99,95.5,0,83],\"<>0\")\n92.5\n```\n\n##Excel Function Documentation:\n* [COUNTIF](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/COUNTIF-function-e0de10c6-f885-4e71-abb4-1f464816df34)\n* [SUMIF](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SUMIF-function-169b8c99-c05c-4483-a712-1697a653039b)\n* [AVERAGEIF](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/AVERAGEIF-function-faec8e2e-0dec-4308-af69-f5576d8ac642)",

They allow you to store data by keys to create nested structures. You are given a dictionary where the keys are strings and the values are strings or dictionaries. The goal is flatten the dictionary, but save the structures in the keys. The result should be a dictionary without the nested dictionaries. The keys should contain paths that contain the parent keys from the original dictionary. The keys in the path are separated by a `/`.

Maybe it was because an ancient fraa and his two fids were copying out books there.

The `fibfusc` function is defined recursively as follows:\n\n    fibfusc(0) = (1, 0)\n    fibfusc(1) = (0, 1)\n    fibfusc(2n) = ((x + y)(x - y), y(2x + 3y)), where (x, y) = fibfusc(n)\n    fibfusc(2n + 1) = (-y(2x + 3y), (x + 2y)(x + 4y)), where (x, y) = fibfusc(n)\n\nYour job is to produce the code for the `fibfusc` function. In this kata, your function will be tested with large values of n (up to 2000 bits), so you should be concerned about stack overflow and timeouts. Moreover, since the `fibfusc` function grows exponentially, your function should take an extra argument `num_digits` with a default value of `None`. When not `None`, `num_digits` takes a positive `int` value and the returned values shall be truncated to the last `num_digits` digits. \n\nFor example, let `n = 101`. With `num_digits` not set or set to `None`, `fibfusc` should return: \n`(-280571172992510140037611932413038677189525L, 734544867157818093234908902110449296423351L)`. If `num_digits = 12`, the function should return `(-38677189525L, 449296423351L)`. Notice in particular, that for any value of `n` greater than 1, `x` is negative, and the truncated value of `x` should also be negative.\n\nHint 1: Use modulo `10 ** num_digits` arithmetic to keep all intermediary results small.\n\nHint 2: Consider using an iterative [\"number climber\"](http://www.codewars.com/kata/number-climber) to avoid stack overflows. \n\n\n",

Looking at the characters that make up the string `\"sarsaparilla\"` we can see that the letter `\"a\"` appears four times, more than any other letter, so the mode of `\"sarsaparilla\"` is `\"a\"`.\n\nBut do you know what happens when two or more data points occur the most? For example, what is the mode of the letters in `\"tomato\"`? Both `\"t\"` and `\"o\"` seem to be tied for appearing most frequently.\n\nTurns out that a set of data can, in fact, have multiple modes, so `\"tomato\"` has two modes: `\"t\"` and `\"o\"`. It's important to note, though, that if *all* data appears the same number of times there is no mode. So `\"cat\"`, `\"redder\"`, and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` do not have a mode.\n\nYour job is to write a function `modes()` that will accept one argument `data` that is a sequence like a string or a list of numbers and return a sorted list containing the mode(s) of the input sequence. If data does not contain a mode you should return an empty list.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> modes(\"tomato\")\n[\"o\", \"t\"]\n>>> modes([1, 3, 3, 7])\n[3]\n>>> modes([\"redder\"])\n[]\n```\n\nYou can trust that your input data will always be a sequence and will always contain orderable types (no inputs like `[1, 2, 2, \"a\", \"b\", \"b\"]`).\n",

That means you should be able to add new functionality to an object or method without altering it.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a lambda, which by nature is lazily bound to the lexical context. Until you ```call``` a lambda, it is just a piece of data you can pass around.\n\n## Task at hand\n\nImplement 3 lambdas that alter a message based on emotion:\n\n```ruby\nspoken    =->(greeting) { ... } # \"hello WORLD\" --> \"Hello world.\"\nshouted   =->(greeting) { ... } # \"Hello world\" --> \"HELLO WORLD!\"\nwhispered =->(greeting) { ... } # \"HELLO WORLD\" --> \"hello world.\"\n```\n```python\nspoken    = lambda greeting: ... # \"hello WORLD\" --> \"Hello world.\"\nshouted   = lambda greeting: ... # \"Hello world\" --> \"HELLO WORLD!\"\nwhispered = lambda greeting: ... # \"HELLO WORLD\" --> \"hello world.\"\n```\n\nThen create a fourth lambda, this one will take one of the above\nlambdas and a message, and the last lambda will delegate the\nemotion and the message up the chain.\n\n```ruby\ngreet =->(style, msg) { ... }\n```\n```python\ngreet = lambda style, msg: ...\n```\n\n## Input\nInput message contains only ASCII alphabets and spaces.\n\n---\n\nWhile here we only test for `spoken`, `shouted`, and `whispered` emotions, the open/closed principle allows us to add functionality to the greet function using other emotions/lambdas as well.\nFor example, feeling like `L33tsp34k1ng` or `sPoNgEbOb MeMe-ing` today? No need to change the original greet function (**closed** for modification), you can just extend the greet function (**open** for extension) by passing a new lambda and message to the greet function.\nSo, embrace the power of open/closed principle now and make your code more flexible and easier to extend!",

The return value should be an array containing the values from the argument arrays that adds up. The sort order of the resulting array is not important. If no combination of numbers adds up return a empty array.\n\n### Example\nA small example: Given the three input arrays `a1 = [1, 2]; a2 = [4,3]; a3 = [6,5,8]`, we need to find the number pairs from `a1` and `a2` that sum up to a number in `a3` and return those three numbers in an array. In this example, the result from the function would be `[[1, 4, 5] , [2, 4, 6], [2, 3, 5]]`.\n```\nGiven three arrays\na1      a2      a3\n 1       4       6          (a1 a2 a3)    (a1 a2 a3)  (a1 a2 a3)\n 2       3       5      =>  [[1, 4, 5] ,  [2, 4, 6],  [2, 3, 5]]\n                 8\n                 \neach value in the result array contains one part from each of the arguments.\n```\n\n\n### Testing\nA function `compare_array` is given. This function takes two arrays and compares them invariant of sort order.\n\n```ruby\nTest.expect(compare_arrays(addsup([1,2], [3,1], [5,4]), [[1,3,4], [2,3,5]]))\n```\n```python\ntest.expect(compare_arrays(addsup([1,2], [3,1], [5,4]), [[1,3,4], [2,3,5]]))\n```\n\n### Greater goal\nFor extra honor try and make it as effective as possible.

Assume all letters are lowercase, except the first letter in the string, the first letter following a period or a question mark, and of course the letter \"I\" ('eye') by itself (no alpha characters before or after it). (Note on Question Mark -- there is no shift key in this kata, so assume all keys are their un-shifted variant, except [/] which should be [?], as shown in the diagram). Use provided test cases if necessary to determine exactly what qualifies as \"by itself\" for the letter I.\n\nHint: For capitalization, letters are alpha (a-z). If a letter should be capitalized following some punctuation, e.g. after a period, the first alpha character after that period should be capitalized. E.g. 'This., Is a test' is valid, 'This., is a test' is not. \n\nExamples:\n```python\nkey_strokes([(5, 1), (2, 0), (8, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 2), (5, 3), (1, 0), (8, 0), (3, 0), (8, 1), (2, 1)])\n'Hello, world'\n```\n\nOther Constraints:\n\n1) Aside from coordinates in the range representing spacebar, you will not receive any coordinates with a y value of 3.\n\n2) All strings will start with an alpha character.\n",

For example, if `x = [1, 2]` and `y = [6, 4]`, then `x + y = [1 + 6, 2 + 4]`, or `[7, 6]`.\n\nYour task has two parts. In Part 1, you'll define a higher order funciton, `vector_op`, that can execute vector operations. In Part 2 you'll define a series of functions to pass as `f` to `vector_op`.\n\n**Part 1:** Define a higher order function, `vector_op(f, *vs)`\n\n`vector_op` takes the following arguments:\n1. `f`, a function, that performs an operation on successive elements of an iterable, e.g., `sum`\n2. `*vs` An arbitrary number of vectors of equal length. We will use the `list` data structure for a vectors.\n\nWrite `vector_op` so that it can take an arbitrary number of lists as arguments after `f` or an iterator of lists.\n\n`vector_op` returns a vector (a `list`) of the same length as those passed as arguments, and is the result of element-wise application of the operation to the vector arguments. \n\n**Special Cases:**\n\n1. With only one vector, it returns that vector unchanged, regardless of which valid f argument you pass.\n2. If any number of empty vectors are passed, it returns an empty vector.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n```python\nvector_op(sum, [1, 2], [6, 4]) => [7, 6]\nvector_op(sum, [1, 2], [6, 4], [2, 1]) => [9, 7]\nvector_op(sum, [1, 2]) => [1, 2] # Special Case 1\nvector_op(sum, [], [], [], [], [], [], []) => [] # Special Case 2\n```\n\n**Part 2:** Define a series of functions to pass to `vector_op`\n\nIn python, we already have a builtin function `sum` that performs a scalar arithmetic operation on an iterable. When we pass `sum`to `vector_op`we have the vector version of addition.\n\nWe're going to define two more functions that we perform scalar operations on iterables, and will perform vector operations when passed to `vector_op`.\n\n**Multiplication:**\nDefine a function `iter_mult` that performs scalar multiplication on an iterable, and performs vector multiplication on an arbitrary number of arguments when passed as `f` to your higher order function `vector_op`. \n\n```python\niter_mult([5, 4, 3]) => 60\niter_mult(1)         => TypeError # as with the built-in sum(), iter_mult() needs an iterable argument\n```\n\n\n**Equals:**\n\nDefine a function `iter_eq` that compares the first and second element of an iterable of two elements and returns `True` or `False` based on that comparison. When you pass it as `f` to `vector_op` it will allow you to return a vector with the results of element-wise comparison of two vectors.\n\n```python\niter_eq([2, 2]) => True # [2, 1] would be False\n```\n\n\nNow you can perform vector multiplication and vector comparisons.\n\n```python\nvector_op(iter_mult, [1, 2], [6, 4]) => [6, 8]\nvector_op(iter_mult, [1, 2])         => [1, 2]\nvector_op(iter_eq, [1, 2], [3, 2])   => [False, True]\nvector_op(iter_eq, [1, 2])           => [1, 2]\n```\n\n\n**More Notes:** \n\n1. Once you complete this, it's trivial to define a vector version of any basic arithmetic or comparative operation.\n2. `iter_mult`and `iter_eq` are not tested for corner cases that aren't applicable to their use in `vector_op`.\n3. `vector_op` is not tested on vectors of unequal length.\n\n",

        "description": "Hi! Welcome to my first kata.\n\nIn this kata the task is to take a list of integers (positive and negative) and split them according to a simple rule; those ints greater than or equal to the key, and those ints less than the key (the itself key will always be positive).\n\nHowever, in this kata the goal is to sort the numbers IN PLACE, so DON'T go messing around with the order in with the numbers appear.\n\nYou are to return a nested list. If the list is empty, simply return an empty list.\n\nConfused? Okay, let me walk you through an example...\n\n    The input is: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 10, 5, 10], the key is: 6\nOkay so the first five numbers are less than the key, 6, so we group them together.\n\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nThe next two numbers, 6 & 10, are both >= 6 to they belong in a seperate group, which we will add to the first group. Like so:\n\n    [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10]]\nThe next two numbers are 5 & 10. Since the key is 6 these two numbers form seperate groups, which we will add to the previous result. like so:\n\n    [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10], [5], [10]]\nAnd voila! We're done.\n \nHere are a few more basic examples:\n\n    group_ints([1, 0], key= 0)  \n    --> [[1,0]]\n  \n    group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 0) \n    --> [[1, 0], [-1], [5]]\n  \n    group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 5) \n    --> [[1, 0, -1], [5]]\n\nGood luck guys/gals!\n\n",

Inputs will always be valid fractions, and the output should also be a string. If the result is an integer, like '2/1', just return '2'. Input numerators (but NOT denominators) can be zero.\n\n#### How the function will be called:\n```ruby\nadd_fracs(any_number_of_fractions1, any_number_of_fractions2, any_number_of_fractions3, ...) #=> a fraction as a string\n```\n\n#### Some examples (see example test cases for more):\n\n```ruby\nadd_fracs() #=> \"\"\nadd_fracs(\"1/2\") #=> \"1/2\"\nadd_fracs(\"1/2\", \"1/4\") #=> \"3/4\"\nadd_fracs(\"1/2\", \"3/4\") #=> \"5/4\"\nadd_fracs(\"2/4\", \"6/4\", \"4/4\") #=> \"3\"\nadd_fracs(\"2/3\", \"1/3\", \"4/6\") #=> \"5/3\"\nadd_fracs(\"-2/3\", \"5/3\", \"-4/6\") #=> \"1/3\"\n```\n\nIf there are any issues with the description, test cases or anything else, please do let me know by commenting or marking an issue. Otherwise, make sure to rank and mark as ready.

        "description": "## Background\n\nA simple statistical analysis of a series of samples can be done with a [Five Figure Summary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary).\n\nThe five figure summary gives the lower extreme, upper extreme, lower quartile, median, and upper quartile, all derived from the supplied sample data.\n\nConfusingly, the five figure summary often includes a sixth value, which is the number of samples in the series.\n\n## Kata\n\nIn this Kata you will be given a class outline to complete. The class will be instantiated with a sequence of values, and you must implement the method to return the six-figure version of a five figure summary.\n\nYou are expected to do the calculations yourself, using pandas or numpy will get you a squinty frown from your sensei! :)\n\n## Inputs\n1. At class instantiation you will be given a sequence of values. This sequence may contain non-numerical values: these should be ignored.\n1. At summary creation you will be given a maximum number of decimal digits `precision` for all the numerical results.  If `None` is supplied, assume full precision has to be returned.\n\n## Calculations\n\n* N: Number of valid numeric values in the sequence.\n* Lower Extreme: The smallest value contained within the sequence.\n* Upper Extreme: The largest value contained within the sequence.\n* Median: The centre value of the sorted sequence of valid values.\n* Lower Quartile: The boundary value between the first and second quarters of the sorted sequence of valid values.\n* Upper Quartile: The boundary value between the third and fourth quarters of the sorted sequence of valid values.\n\nThe median and both quartiles may need to be a linear interpolation between two values.\n\n### Linear Interpolation Examples\nGiven a sequence of values `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n\n1. Position `3.5` would return the mid-point between the values at index `3` and index `4` returning `5.5`.\n1. Position `1.25` would return the quarter-point between the values at index `1` and index `2` returning `3.25`.\n1. Position `6.75` would return the three-quarter-point between the values at index `6` and index `7` returning `7.75`.\n\n### Outputs\n\nYou will return a tuple with the calculated values in the following order:\n\n    (N, lower_extreme, upper_extreme, lower_quartile, median, upper_quartile)\n\nWhere no precision is defined, and given the rounding/quantization errors with floating point processing, your answers must be within `10 ** -10` of the correct answer. Where precision is defined, your answer is expected to be exact.\n\n### Worked Example\n    data = range(0, 7)\n    StatisticalSummary(data).five_figure_summary(2)   =>   (7, 0, 6, 1.5, 3, 4.5)\n<br>\n# Series\n\nThis kata is part of a series of kata about basis statistics, you are advised to tackle them in sequence.\n\nThe kata are:\n\n* [Intro to Statistics - Part 1: A Five figure summary](http://www.codewars.com/kata/intro-to-statistics-part-1-a-five-figure-summary)\n* [Intro to Statistics - Part 2: Boxplots](https://www.codewars.com/kata/intro-to-statistics-part-2-boxplots)\n",

Where `n` is the starting number and `m` is the ending number.\n\nFor example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary:\n\n```python\n{2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]}\n```\n\n",

However, if 2 titles are purchased, a 5% discount will be received, i.e. purchasing \"Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"Two Towers\" will cost $19. If 3 different titles are purchased, a 10% discount will be received. The purchase of all 4 different titles will receive a 20% discount. An additional single title will be full-price.\n\nThe encoding of an order will be in the form of strings in an array. For example: `[\u201cF\u201d, \u201cT\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cH\u201d, \u201cH\u201d]` is the encoding of 2 copies of \"The Hobbit\" and a single copy of each of the titles in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n\nThe expected output is a number. E.g. `42` is the expected output for the example above.\nThe output should be the cheapest total cost. For example - if the book order is `[\"F\", \"T\", \"H\", \"F\", \"T\", \"R\"]`, valid total costs include `(3*10 discounted by 10%) + (3*10 discounted by 10%)` and `(4*10 discounted by 20%) + (2*10 discounted by 5%)`. The cheapest total cost is `51`.\n\nThis is a slightly simplified version of http://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/",

So, for the example above and F = 7, we get the sequence ```[1 * 7, 3 * 7, 6 * 7, 13 * 7] = [7, 21, 42, 91]```. Notice:\n\n1. The last number in the sequence is ```N * F```\n2. Each number in the sequence is either the double of the previous number or the double plus F.\n\nWrite a function ```multiply``` that takes two positive integers as arguments and returns the product of the two numbers. You are *only* allowed to use \n  \n - left and right shifts `<<, >>`, \n - addition and subtraction `+, -`\n - logical operators `^, &, |, ~` \n - comparisons `<, <=, >=, >`. \n\nYou may *not* use the `*` operator or a builtin or imported multiplication function. \n\nAlso, you may not use any integer literal. Use the preprovided `zero` and `one` to denote the numbers 0 and 1 respectively. ",

Therefore :\n```haskell\n(crossover [1] ['a','b','c'] ['x','y','z']) `shouldBe` (['a','y','z'],['x','b','c'])\n```\n ```ocaml\n(crossover [1] ['a';'b';'c'] ['x';'y';'z']) should be (['a';'y';'z'],['x';'b';'c'])\n```\n```python\ncrossover([1],['a','b','c'],['x','y','z']) should be (['a','y','z'],['x','b','c'])\n```\n```go\nCrossover([]int { 1 }, []int {1,2,3}, []int {11,12,13}) should be ([]int { 1,12,13 }, int[] { 11,2,3 })\n```\n```scala\ncrossover(List(1),List('a','b','c'),List('x','y','z')) should be (List('a','y','z'), List('x','b','c'))\n```\n```rust\ncrossover(&[1], &[1,2,3], &[11,12,13]) should be (vec![1,12,13],vec![11,2,3])\n```\n\nIf a cross-point index is repeated, it should be considered only once. Indices can also be provided unordered, so your function could be called with the following indices :\n\n```haskell\ncrossover [7,5,3,5] xs ys\n```\n```ocaml\ncrossover [7;5;3;5] xs ys\n```\n```python\ncrossover([7,5,3,5], xs, ys) \n```\n```go\nCrossover(int[] { 7,5,3,5 }, xs, ys) \n```\n```scala\ncrossover(List(7,5,3,5), xs, ys)\n```\n```rust\ncrossover(&[7,5,3,5], &xs, &ys)\n```\nIn this case, you would have to consider only indices [7,5,3] and deal with the fact they are unordered.\n\nChromosome indices are 0-based and you can also assume that :\n<ol>\n<li> (length xs) == (length ys) </li>\n<li> crossover indices will never exceed the length of xs or ys. </li>\n</ol>",

Difficulties will be an integer, and they may be positive, negative or zero.\n\nJim and Bob have the job of doing all the jobs, but we need to find the position in the container where we can make a cut so that Jim and Bob have the most even workload to perform.\n\n## Kata\n\nYour task is to write a function that identifies the place to split the workload for Jim and Bob, it will be supplied with a container of difficulty ratings, and you must return a tuple/array with (the optimum location of the split, the difference between the two total workloads).  If no workload is provided, then return `(None, None)`/`[null, null]`.\n\n### Worked Example\nThe workload we are give to split is as follows:\n```python\nsplit_workload([1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1])\n```\n```javascript\nsplitWorkload([1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1])\n```\nIf we try cutting at each position then:\n```\nSplit  Jim's work             Bob's work              Ratio  Difference\n0      [],                    [1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1]   0:22   22\n1      [1]                    [6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1]      1:21   20\n2      [1, 6]                 [2, 3, 5, 4, 1]         7:15   8\n3      [1, 6, 2]              [3, 5, 4, 1]            9:13   4\n4      [1, 6, 2, 3]           [5, 4, 1]               12:10  2\n5      [1, 6, 2, 3, 5]        [4, 1]                  17:5   12\n6      [1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4]     [1]                     21:1   20\n7      [1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1]  []                      22:0   22\n```\n\nAs you can see when we split at position 4, we get the most even split with a difference of only 2.  In the event of a tie where the minimum difference occurs more than once, we take the first position that gives the most even split.\n\nThus for our example, the result would be:\n```python\nsplit_workload([1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1]) -> (4, 2)\n```\n```javascript\nsplitWorkload([1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1]) -> [4, 2]\n```\n\nYou get self-awarded bonus points if your answer runs in `O(n)` time and memory constraints.",

While they are often confused with each other, they work differently. The goal is to learn to differentiate them.\n\n## Currying\n\n> Is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions each with a single argument.\n\nCurrying takes a function:\n\n```\nf: X \u00d7 Y \u2192 R\n```\n\nand turns it into a function:\n\n```\nf': X \u2192 (Y \u2192 R)\n```\n\nInstead of calling `f` with two arguments, we invoke `f'` with the first argument. The result is a function that we then call with the second argument to produce the result. Thus, if the uncurried `f` is invoked as:\n\n```\nf(3, 5)\n```\n\nthen the curried `f'` is invoked as:\n\n`f'(3)(5)`\n\n### Example\n\nGiven this function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(x, y, z) {\n  return x + y + z;\n}\n```\n```python\ndef add(x, y, z):\n  return x + y + z\n```\n```php\nfunction add($x, $y, $z) {\n  return $x + $y + $z;\n}\n```\n\nWe can call in a normal way:\n\n\n```javascript\nadd(1, 2, 3); //6\n```\n```python\nadd(1, 2, 3) # => 6\n```\n```php\nadd(1, 2, 3); //6\n```\n\nBut we can create a curried version of `add(a, b, c)`function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction curriedAdd(a) {\n  return function(b) {\n    return function (c) {\n      return add(a, b, c);\n    };\n  };\n}\n\ncurriedAdd(1)(2)(3); //6\n```\n```python\ncurriedAdd = lambda a: (lambda b: (lambda c: add(a,b,c)))\ncurriedAdd(1)(2)(3) # => 6\n```\n```php\nfunction curriedAdd($a) {\n  return function($b) use ($a) {\n    return function($c) use ($a, $b) {\n      return add($a, $b, $c);\n    };\n  };\n}\n\ncurriedAdd(1)(2)(3); //6\n```\n\n## Partial application\n\n> Is the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.\n\nPartial application takes a function:\n\n```\nf: X \u00d7 Y \u2192 R\n```\n\nand a fixed value `x` for the first argument to produce a new function\n\n```\nf': Y \u2192 R\n```\n\n`f'` does the same as `f`, but only has to fill in the second parameter which is why its arity is one less than the arity of `f`. One says that the first argument is bound to `x`.\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nfunction partialAdd(a) {\n  return function(b, c) {\n    return add(a, b, c);\n  };\n}\n\npartialAdd(1)(2, 3); //6\n```\n```python\npartialAdd = lambda a: (lambda *args: add(a,*args))\npartialAdd(1)(2, 3) # => 6\n```\n```php\nfunction partialAdd($a) {\n  return function($b, $c) use ($a) {\n    return add($a, $b, $c);\n  };\n}\n\npartialAdd(1)(2, 3); //6\n```\n\n-------------\n\nYour work is to implement a generic `curryPartial()` function allows either currying or partial application.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nvar curriedAdd = curryPartial(add);\ncurriedAdd(1)(2)(3); //6\n\nvar partialAdd = curryPartial(add, 1);\npartialAdd(2, 3); //6\n```\n```python\ncurriedAdd = curryPartial(add)\ncurriedAdd(1)(2)(3) # => 6\n\npartialAdd = curryPartial(add, 1)\npartialAdd(2, 3) # => 6\n```\n```php\n$add = function ($a, $b, $c) {\n  return $a + $b + $c;\n};\n$curriedAdd = curryPartial($add);\n$curriedAdd(1)(2)(3); //6\n\nfunction add($a, $b, $c) {\n  return $a + $b + $c;\n}\n$partialAdd = curryPartial('add', 1);\n$partialAdd(2, 3); //6\n```\n\nWe want the function be very flexible.\n\nAll these examples should produce the same result:\n\n```javascript\ncurryPartial(add)(1)(2)(3); //6\ncurryPartial(add, 1)(2)(3); //6\ncurryPartial(add, 1)(2, 3); //6\ncurryPartial(add, 1, 2)(3); //6\ncurryPartial(add, 1, 2, 3); //6\ncurryPartial(add)(1, 2, 3); //6\ncurryPartial(add)(1, 2)(3); //6\ncurryPartial(add)()(1, 2, 3); //6\ncurryPartial(add)()(1)()()(2)(3); //6\n\ncurryPartial(add)()(1)()()(2)(3, 4, 5, 6); //6\ncurryPartial(add, 1)(2, 3, 4, 5); //6\n```\n```python\ncurryPartial(add)(1)(2)(3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add, 1)(2)(3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add, 1)(2, 3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add, 1, 2)(3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add, 1, 2, 3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add)(1, 2, 3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add)(1, 2)(3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add)()(1, 2, 3) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add)()(1)()()(2)(3) # =>6 \n\ncurryPartial(add)()(1)()()(2)(3, 4, 5, 6) # =>6 \ncurryPartial(add, 1)(2, 3, 4, 5) # =>6 \n```\n```php\ncurryPartial($add)(1)(2)(3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add, 1)(2)(3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add, 1)(2, 3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add, 1, 2)(3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add, 1, 2, 3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add)(1, 2, 3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add)(1, 2)(3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add)()(1, 2, 3); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add)()(1)()()(2)(3); # =>6 \n\ncurryPartial($add)()(1)()()(2)(3, 4, 5, 6); # =>6 \ncurryPartial($add, 1)(2, 3, 4, 5); # =>6 \n```\n\nAnd also all of these:\n\n```javascript\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2), 3); //6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1, 2), 3); //6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2, 3); //6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2)(3); //6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1)(2), 3); //6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1)), 2, 3); //6\n```\n```python\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2), 3) # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1, 2), 3) # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2, 3) # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2)(3) # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1)(2), 3) # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1)), 2, 3) # =>6\n```\n```php\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial($add, 1), 2), 3); # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial($add, 1, 2), 3); # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial($add, 1), 2, 3); # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial($add, 1), 2)(3); # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial($add, 1)(2), 3); # =>6\ncurryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial($add, 1)), 2, 3); # =>6\n```",

This means you can't hard-code the answers.\n* Only these characters may be included in your returned string: \n~~~if-not:c\n`01?:*+^$()[]|`\n~~~\n~~~if:c\n`01?*+^$()|` (POSIX Extended Regular Expressions subset)\n~~~\n\n~~~if:javascript\n## Javascript Notes\n\n* Do **not** include the regex caps `/.../`. Your string will be used as such: `RegExp(regexDivisibleBy(3))` in the tests.\n* No funny business! There should be no need for prototyping, so don't even think about it.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\n## Python Notes\n\n* Whenever you use parentheses `(...)`, instead use non-capturing ones `(?:...)`. This is due to `module re`'s restriction in the number of capturing (or named) groups, which is capped at 99.\n* Each regex will be tested with `re.search`, so be sure to include both starting and ending marks in your regex.\n* The second anti-cheat test checks if you used any of `re`, `sys`, or `print` in your code. You won't need to print anything since each test will show what numbers your code is being tested on.\n~~~\n~~~if:java\n## Java Notes\n\n* The second anti-cheat test checks if you used any of `System`, `io`, `regex`, `zip` in your code. You won't need to print anything since each test will show what numbers your code is being tested on.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:cpp\n## C++ Notes\n\n* The second anti-cheat test checks if you used the STL's regex library in your code.\n* The macro constant `_GLIBCXX_REGEX_STATE_LIMIT` which limits the maximum size of a regex has been set to `400000`, as the default limit would be too constraining for the larger inputs.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:kotlin\n\n## Kotlin Notes\n\n* The second anti-cheat test checks if you used any of `System`, `io`, `regex`, `zip` in your code.

You won't need to print anything since each test will show what numbers your code is being tested on.\n~~~\n~~~if:rust\n## Rust Notes\n\n* Each regex will be tested with `regex::Regex.is_match()`, so be sure to include both starting and ending marks in your regex.\n* The second anti-cheat test checks if you used the `regex` or `std::io` modules in your code; the tests will take care of compiling the regex string for you.\n~~~\n",

The more common name of this function is concealed in order to not tempt you to search the Web for help in solving this kata, which most definitely would be a very dishonorable thing to do.\n\nAssume `n` has `m` bits. Then `mystery(n)` is the number whose binary representation is the entry in the table `T(m)` at index position `n`, where `T(m)` is defined recursively as follows:\n\n```\nT(1) = [0, 1]\n```\n\n`T(m + 1)` is obtained by taking two copies of `T(m)`, reversing the second copy, prepending each entry of the first copy with `0` and each entry of the reversed copy with `1`, and then concatenating the two. For example:\n\n```\nT(2) = [ 00, 01, 11, 10 ]\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nT(3) = [ 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100 ]\n```\n\n`mystery(6)` is the entry in `T(3)` at index position 6 (with indexing starting at `0`), i.e., `101` interpreted as a binary number. So, `mystery(6)` returns `5`.\n\nYour mission is to implement the function `mystery`, where the argument may have up to 63 bits. Note that `T(63)` is far too large to compute and store, so you'll have to find an alternative way of implementing `mystery`.  \n\n```if-not:commonlisp\nYou are also asked to implement `mystery_inv` ( or `mysteryInv` ), the inverse of `mystery`. Finally, you are asked to implement a function `name_of_mystery` ( or `nameOfMystery` ), which shall return the name that `mystery` is more commonly known as.

This step is a step-up, or `U`.\n\nAlso, for any starting number, the sequence is generated indefinitely, not ending at 1.\n\n# Problem Description\n\nFor any given starting number, we can record the types of steps(`D` or `U`) from it.\nFor example, if we start with the number 11, the Collatz steps look like this:\n```\na[0] = 11\na[1] = (11 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 17 -> U\na[2] = (17 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 26 -> U\na[3] = 26 / 2 = 13           -> D\na[4] = (13 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 20 -> U\na[5] = 20 / 2 = 10           -> D\na[6] = 10 / 2 = 5            -> D\na[7] = (5 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 8   -> U\na[8] = 8 / 2 = 4             -> D\na[9] = 4 / 2 = 2             -> D\na[10] = 2 / 2 = 1            -> D\na[11] = (1 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 2  -> U\na[12] = 2 / 2 = 1            -> D\n...\n```\n\n```\n11 -> 17 -> 26 -> 13 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...\n   U     U     D     U     D     D    U    D    D    D    U    D\n```\n\nBased on the steps shown above, the first four Collatz steps of 11 is `UUDU`.\nAlso, 107 is the smallest number over 100 whose Collatz steps start with `UUDU`, and\n1003 is the smallest number over 1000 with the property.\n\nA special example is the number 1, which can generate any number of `UD`.\n\nFind the smallest integer exceeding or equal to `n` whose Collatz steps start with the given string `steps`.\n\n# Constraints\n\n`1 <= n <= 10 ** 9`\n\n`n` is always a valid integer.\n\n`1 <= length(steps) <= 25`\n\nThe string `steps` will entirely consist of `U`s and `D`s.\n\n# Examples\n\n```python\ncollatz_steps(1, 'UUDU') == 11\ncollatz_steps(100, 'UUDU') == 107\ncollatz_steps(1000, 'UUDU') == 1003\n\ncollatz_steps(1, 'UD') == 1\ncollatz_steps(1, 'UDUD') == 1\ncollatz_steps(1, 'UDUDUD') == 1\n```\n\n```javascript\ncollatzSteps(1, 'UUDU') == 11\ncollatzSteps(100, 'UUDU') == 107\ncollatzSteps(1000, 'UUDU') == 1003\n\ncollatzSteps(1, 'UD') == 1\ncollatzSteps(1, 'UDUD') == 1\ncollatzSteps(1, 'UDUDUD') == 1\n```\n\n# Hint\n\nIf you are completely lost, start by answering the following question:\n\n* After applying the given steps (e.g. `UUDU`) to an initial number `x`,\n  what fraction do you get?\n  \nAfter that, you might want to study about [modular inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse).\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\nThis problem was inspired by [Project Euler #277: A Modified Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=277).\n\nIf you enjoyed this Kata, please also have a look at [my other Katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/Bubbler/authored)!",

        "description": "A [Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) (FSM) is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. Simple examples are:\n\n* vending machines, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited;\n* elevators, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders;\n* traffic lights, which change sequence when cars are waiting;\n* combination locks, which require the input of combination numbers in the proper order.\n\n\nIn this Kata we are going to design our very own basic FSM ```class``` that takes in a ```string``` of ```instructions```\n\n```instructions``` is a string input with the following format:\n\n```\nfirst; next_if_input_0, next_if_input_1; output\\n\nsecond; next_if_input_0, next_if_input_1; output\\n\nthird; next_if_input_0, next_if_input_1; output\n```\n\nA basic example would be:\n\n```python\ninstructions = \\\n'''S1;

Your assignment is to write a function with signature `distribute(m, n)` in which `m` represents how many candies there are, while `n` represents how many children there are. The function should return a container which includes the number of candies each child gains.\n\n# Notice\n1. *The candy can't be divided into pieces.*\n2. The list's order doesn't matter.\n\n# Requirements\n1. The case `m < 0` is equivalent to `m == 0`.\n2. If `n <= 0` the function should return an empty container. \n3. If there isn't enough candy to distribute, you should fill the corresponding number with `0`.\n\n# Examples\n```ruby\ndistribute(-5,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute( 0,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute( 5,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute(10,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute(15,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute(-5, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute( 0, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute( 5, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute(10, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute(15, -5) # should be []\ndistribute(-5, 10) # should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute( 0, 10) # should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute( 5, 10) # should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute(10, 10) # should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\ndistribute(15, 10) # should be [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n```\n```python\ndistribute(-5,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute( 0,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute( 5,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute(10,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute(15,  0) # should be [] \ndistribute(-5, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute( 0, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute( 5, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute(10, -5) # should be [] \ndistribute(15, -5) # should be []\ndistribute(-5, 10) # should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute( 0, 10) # should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute( 5, 10) # should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute(10, 10) # should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\ndistribute(15, 10) # should be [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n```\n```javascript\ndistribute(-5,  0) // should be [] \ndistribute( 0,  0) // should be [] \ndistribute( 5,  0) // should be [] \ndistribute(10,  0) // should be [] \ndistribute(15,  0) // should be [] \ndistribute(-5, -5) // should be [] \ndistribute( 0, -5) // should be [] \ndistribute( 5, -5) // should be [] \ndistribute(10, -5) // should be [] \ndistribute(15, -5) // should be []\ndistribute(-5, 10) // should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute( 0, 10) // should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute( 5, 10) // should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ndistribute(10, 10) // should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\ndistribute(15, 10) // should be [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n```\n```cpp\ndistribute(-5,  0) // should be {}\ndistribute( 0,  0) // should be {} \ndistribute( 5,  0) // should be {} \ndistribute(10,  0) // should be {} \ndistribute(15,  0) // should be {} \ndistribute(-5, -5) // should be {} \ndistribute( 0, -5) // should be {} \ndistribute( 5, -5) // should be {} \ndistribute(10, -5) // should be {} \ndistribute(15, -5) // should be {}\ndistribute(-5, 10) // should be {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}\ndistribute( 0, 10) // should be {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}\ndistribute( 5, 10) // should be {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}\ndistribute(10, 10) // should be {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}\ndistribute(15, 10) // should be {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n```\n  \n# Input\n  1. m: Integer (m <= 100000)\n  2. n: Integer (n <= 1000)\n\n# Output\n  1.

The book is full of a bunch of problems, and each problem consists of two strings that are similar. However, in each string there are a few characters that are different. An example puzzle from her book is:\n```\nString 1: \"abcdefg\"\nString 2: \"abcqetg\"\n```\nNotice how the \"d\" from String 1 has become a \"q\" in String 2, and \"f\" from String 1 has become a \"t\" in String 2.\n\nIt's your job to help Mary solve the puzzles. Write a program `spot_diff`/`Spot` that will compare the two strings and return a list with the positions where the two strings differ. In the example above, your program should return `[3, 5]` because String 1 is different from String 2 at positions 3 and 5.\n\nNOTES:\n\n```if-not:csharp\n\u2022 If both strings are the same, return `[]`\n```\n```if:csharp\n\u2022 If both strings are the same, return `new List<int>()`\n```\n\n\u2022 Both strings will always be the same length\n\n\u2022 Capitalization and punctuation matter",

We won't know it, but we will write it. We have to prepare mechanism to create <strong>dynamic classes with properties and methods</strong> given as a parameters.</em> - explained boss.\n<br /><em>- I don't think that's, umm... But would we at least know names of these properties and methods, right?</em>\n<br /><em>- No. Remember that it's secret, so we'll not know anything!</em>\n<br /><em>- Nah, it's impossible!</em> - cried Tim.\n\nThen Tims went to find you - his almighty guru - and ask to help him. You reminded him: -<em> It's Python, here everything is possible! Ok, let's see...</em>.\n\nSo, in that Kata, your task is to finish function ```create_class``` that will get some class name and <em>secret</em> dictionary and make class of it. That dictionary will be delivered by function ```army_get_secret_from_file()``` which is already completed. \nTim also asked you to make sure that if class name is empty, it should be None as result, and to make possible to call function without second parameter. Returned object should be the new-style class, which has only to inherit the base methods of the class `object`.\n\nDo not worry, these test properties and methods are dummy, so you won't know the army's mysteries, so you (probably) won't be executed. \n\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Check also previous: <a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/pythons-dynamic-classes-number-1\"> Python's Dynamic Classes #1 Kata</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/pythons-dynamic-classes-number-2\"> Python's Dynamic Classes #2 Kata</a></strong>.",

        "description": "Removed due to copyright infringement.\n\n<!---\n\nLittle Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited `N` his friends there.\n\nIf there's one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that's watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from `1` to `N`. Petya remembered that a friend number `i` gave a gift to a friend number `j`. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.\n\nNow Petya wants to know for each friend `i` the number of a friend who has given him a gift.\n\n### Input\n\nInput contains array with `N` integers: the `i`-th number is the number of the friend who was given a present by friend number `i`. It is guaranteed that each friend received exactly one gift. It is possible that some friends do not share Petya's ideas of giving gifts to somebody else. Those friends gave the gifts to themselves.\n\n### Output\n\nReturn array with `N` integers: the `i`-th number should equal the number of the friend who gave a gift to friend number `i`.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n[2, 3, 4, 1]  =>  [4, 1, 2, 3]\n[1, 3, 2]     =>  [1, 3, 2]\n[1, 2]        =>  [1, 2]\n```\n\nFirst example step-by-step explanation (note: the explanation uses 1-based indexing to make the correspondence with friend-numbering clearer):\n\n1. The friend `1` gave gift to the friend `2` (`a[1] == 2`) - this means that in the output array number `1` is at position `2` : `[_, 1, _, _]`.\n1. The friend `2` gave gift to the friend `3` (`a[2] == 3`) - this means that in the output array number `2` is at position `3` : `[_, 1, 2, _]`.\n1. The friend `3` gave gift to the friend `4` (`a[3] == 4`) - this means that in the output array number `3` is at position `4` : `[_, 1, 2, 3]`.\n1. The friend `4` gave gift to the friend `1` (`a[4] == 1`) - this means that in the output array number `4` is at position `1` : `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n(c)KADR\n\n--->",

Unlike other modern computers, \"Ternatron IV\" operates with ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the xor operation is performed on this computer (and whether there is anything like it).\n\n&ensp;It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is called tor) and it works like this. Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression A tor B. Both numbers A and B are written in the ternary notation one under the other one (B under A). If they have a different number of digits, then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit. The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3. Note that there is no carry between digits (i. e. during this operation the digits aren't transferred). For example: 14<sub>10</sub> tor 50<sub>10</sub>\u2009 == \u20090112<sub>3</sub> tor 1212<sub>3</sub>\u2009 == \u20091021<sub>3</sub>\u2009 == \u200934<sub>10</sub>.\n\n&ensp;Petya wrote numbers A and C on a piece of paper.

        "description": "# Story\n\nIt's a pretty relaxing life here at the nut farm.\n\nMost of the time we just sit around looking at our nuts.\n\nBut once a year comes harvesting time...\n\nHarvesting nuts is very easy. We just shake the trees and the nuts fall out!\n\n---\n\nAs they fall down the nuts might hit branches:\n* Sometimes they bounce left.\n* Sometimes they bounce right.\n* Sometimes they get stuck in the tree and don't fall out at all.\n\n# Legend\n\n* ```o``` = a nut\n* ```\\``` = branch. A nut hitting this branch bounces right\n* ```/``` = branch. A nut hitting this branch bounces left\n* ```_``` = branch. A nut hitting this branch gets stuck in the tree\n* ```.``` = leaves, which have no effect on falling nuts\n* ```|``` = tree trunk, which has no effect on falling nuts\n* ``` ``` = empty space, which has no effect on falling nuts\n\n# Kata Task\n\nShake the tree and count where the nuts land.\n\n**Output** - An array (same width as the tree) which indicates how many nuts fell at each position ^\n\n^ See the example tests\n\n# Notes\n\n* The nuts are always found at the top of the tree\n* Nuts do not affect the falling patterns of other nuts\n* There are always enough spaces for nuts to fall between branches\n* There are no branches at the extreme left/right edges of the tree matrix so it is not possible for a nut to fall \"out of bounds\"\n\n# Example\n\n<pre

        "description": "The Stack Arithmetic Machine\n---------------------------\n\nThis time we're going to be writing a stack arithmetic machine, and we're going to call it Sam. Essentially, Sam is a very small virtual machine, with a simple intruction set, four general registers, and a stack. We've already given a CPU class, which gives you read and write access to registers and the stack, through `readReg()` and `writeReg()`, and `popStack()` and `writeStack()` respectively. All instructions on Sam are 32-bit (Java int), and either interact with the stack, or one of the 4 registers; `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`.\n<hr>\nThe CPU API\n-----------\n\nThe CPU instructions available through the CPU class, with a bit more detail:\n```java\nint readReg(String name): Returns the value of the named register.\nvoid writeReg(String name, int value): Stores the value into the given register.\n\nint popStack(): Pops the top element of the stack, returning the value.\nvoid writeStack(int value): Pushes an element onto the stack.\n```\n\n```python\nread_reg(self, name): Returns the value of the named register.\nwrite_reg(self, name, value): Stores the value into the given register.\n\npop_stack(self): Pops the top element of the stack, returning the value.\nwrite_stack(self, value): Pushes an element onto the stack.\n```\n\n```csharp\npublic int ReadReg(string name): Returns the value of the named register.\npublic void WriteReg(string name, int value): Stores the value into the given register.\n\npublic int PopStack(): Pops the top element of the stack, returning the value.\npublic void WriteStack(int value): Pushes an element onto the stack.\npublic void PrintStack(): Prints the contents of the stack to System.Console.\n```\n\nNote that the registers have a default value of `0` and  that the sStack is printable (if needed).\n\n<hr>\n\nThe Instruction Set\n-------------------\n\nInstructions for same are done in assembly style, and are passed one by one into the `Exec|exec|execute` function (depending on your language). Each instruction begins with the name of the operation, and is optionally followed by either one or two operands. The operands are marked in the table below by either `[reg]`, which accepts a register name, or `[reg|int]` which accepts either a register, or an immediate integer value.\n\n### Stack Operations\n\n```\npush [reg|int]: Pushes a register [reg] or an immediate value [int] to the stack.\n\npop: Pops a value of the stack, discarding the value.\n\npop [reg]: Pops a value of the stack, into the given register [reg].\n\npushr: Pushes the general registers onto the stack, in order. (a, b, c, d)\n\npushrr: Pushes the general registers onto the stack, in reverse order. (d, c, b, a)\n\npopr: Pops values off the stack, and loads them into the general registers, in order so that the two executions `pushr()`  and `popr()` would leave the registers unchanged.\n\npoprr: Pops values off the stack, and loads them into the general registers, in order so that the two executions `pushr()`  and `poprr()` would invert the values of the registers from left to right.\n```\n\n### Misc Operations\n\n```\nmov [reg|int], [reg2]: Stores the value from [reg|int] into the register [reg2].\n```\n\n### Arithmetic Operations\n\n```\nadd [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the sum in register a.\n\nsub [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the difference in register a.\n\nmul [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the product in register a.\n\ndiv [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the quotient in register a.\n\nand [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, performing a bit-and operation, and storing the result in register a.\n\nor [reg|int] : Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, performing a bit-or operation, and storing the result in register a.\n\nxor [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, performing a bit-xor operation, and storing the result in register a.\n```\n\nAll arithmetic operations have 4 variants; they may be suffixed with the character `'a'` (`adda`, `xora`), and they may take an additional register parameter, which is the destination register. Thus, using add as an example:\n```\nadd 5: Adds the top 5 values of the stack, storing the result in register a.\n\nadd 5, b: Adds the top 5 values of the stack, storing the result in register b instead.\n\nadda 5: Pushes the value of register A onto the stack, then adds the top 5 values of the stack, and stores the result in register a.\n\nadda 5, b: Pushes the value of register A onto the stack, adds the top 5 values of the stack, and stores the result in register b.\n```\n\nAll arithmetic instructions may also take a register as their first argument, to perform a variable number of operation, as follows:\n```\nmov 3, a: Stores the number 3 in register a.\nadd a: Adds the top a values of the stack (in this case 3), storing the result in register a.\n```",

        "description": "In this Kata, you're going to transpile an expression from one langauge into another language.\n\nThe source language looks like Kotlin and the target language looks like Dart. And you **don't need to know neither of them** to complete this Kata.\n\nWe're going to transpile a `function call` expression.\n\nIf you successfully parsed the input, return `Right output`, otherwise give me `Left \"Hugh?\"`.\n~~~if:java\nFor Java, return the empty string upon failure, else the transpiled string.\n~~~\n~~~if:csharp\nFor C#, return the empty string upon failure, else the transpiled string.\n~~~\n~~~if:c\nFor C, return the empty string upon failure, else the transpiled string.\n~~~\n~~~if:cpp\nFor C++, return the empty string upon failure, else the transpiled string.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nFor Python, return the empty string upon failure, else the transpiled string.\n~~~\n~~~if:ruby\nFor Ruby, return the empty string upon failure, else the transpiled string.\n~~~\n~~~if:rust\nFor Rust, return `Ok(transpiled string)` on success, or `Err(\"Hugh?\")` on failure.\n~~~\n\nWe have three kinds of basic expressions:\n\n+ names, like `abc`, `ABC`, `run`, `a1`, beginning with `_`/letters and followed by `_`/letters/numbers\n+ numbers, like `123`, `02333`, `66666` (may have leading zeroes)\n+ lambda expressions, like `{ a -> a }`, `{ a, b -> a b }`(source), `(a){a;}`, `(a,b){a;b;}`(target)\n\nWe have empty characters `blank space` and `\\n`.\n\nThe definition of `names` is quite similiar to C/Java. Names like this are invalid:\n\n+ `1a`\n\nYou don't have to worry about reserved words here.\n\nLambda expressions consist of two parts:\n\n+ parameters, they're just names/numbers\n+ statements, a list of names/numbers, seperated by whitespaces in source language, by `;` in target language.\n\nInvoking a function is to pass some arguments to something callable(names and lambdas), like `plus(1, 2)`, or `repeat(10, { xxx })`.\n\nThere's a syntax sugar in Kotlin: if the last argument is a lambda, it can be out of the brackets. Like, `repeat(10, { xxx })` can be written in `repeat(10) { xxx }`. And if that lambda is the only argument, you can even ignore the brackets. Like: `run({ xxx })` is equaled to `run { xxx }`.\n\nYou can refer to the examples at the bottom.\n\n## The source language looks like:\n\n```\nfunction ::= expression \"(\" [parameters] \")\" [lambda]\n           | expression lambda\n\nexpression ::= nameOrNumber\n             | lambda\n\nparameters ::= expression [\",\" parameters]\n\nlambdaparam ::= nameOrNumber [\",\" lambdaparam]\nlambdastmt  ::= nameOrNumber [lambdastmt]\n\nlambda ::= \"{\" [lambdaparam \"->\"] [lambdastmt] \"}\"\n```\n\nNotice: there can be whitespaces among everywhere, it's not a part of the language grammar.\n\n## The target language looks like:\n\n```\nfunction ::= expression \"(\" [parameters] \")\"\n\nexpression ::= nameOrNumber\n             | lambda\n\nparameters ::= expression [\",\" parameters]\n\nlambdaparam ::= nameOrNumber [\",\" lambdaparam]\nlambdastmt  ::= nameOrNumber \";\" [lambdastmt]\n\nlambda ::= \"(\" [lambdaparam] \"){\" [lambdastmt] \"}\"\n```\n\nYou shouldn't produce any whitespaces in the target language.\n\nThose examples covered all the language features shown above. Hope you enjoy it :D\n\n`fun()` => `fun()`  \n`fun(a)` => `fun(a)`  \n`fun(a, b)` => `fun(a,b)`  \n`{}()` => `(){}()`  \n`fun {}` => `fun((){})`  \n`fun(a, {})` => `fun(a,(){})`  \n`fun(a) {}` => `fun(a,(){})`  \n`fun {a -> a}` => `fun((a){a;})`  \n`{a -> a}(1)` => `(a){a;}(1)`  \n`fun { a, b -> a b }` => `fun((a,b){a;b;})`  \n`{a, b -> a b} (1, 2)` => `(a,b){a;b;}(1,2)`  \n`f { a }` => `f((){a;})`  \n`f { a -> }` => `f((a){})`\\\n`{}{}` => `(){}((){})`\n\n~~~if:javascript,haskell,python,ruby,java,rust,csharp\nYou have to write your own tokenizer (hint: whitespace is significant to separate some tokens, but can be ignored otherwise).\n~~~\n~~~if:c,cpp\nA tokenizer is provided.\n~~~\n\n",

This russianNestingDoll instance may contain another russianNestingDoll. RussianNestingDolls are callable, such that if a nesting doll contains another nesting doll, calling it [like a function with no parameters, e.g. <code>russianNestingDoll()</code>] will return the smaller nesting doll inside. If it is empty (i.e., it does not contain another doll), it will return <code>None</code>. Your task is to return the size of the smallest doll (russianNestingDolls have a \"size\" attribute). \n\n*Don't worry about Python's recursion limit.*  \n*Depending on what you value most in your code, you may prefer an iterative solution.*\n\nHappy coding!",

It is dropped by carrier ships (known as Carryalls) onto spice fields. Harvesters harvest and process the spice off the top of the desert floor.\n\nBecause of the rhythmic sound they make, harvesters are regularly eaten by sandworms (on the planet *Arrakis*, sandworms were reported to range from 100 meters to up to 450 meters in length). That's why 2 or 3 ornithopters (called spotters) are deployed to scout from the skies to watch for wormsign. Upon detection of wormsign (ie. worm movement), the spotters then contact the nearest Carryall for pickup of the target harvester.\n\n[1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)\n\nGoal:\n=====\nAs a spotter pilot, you are responsible for handling dispatch of Carryalls in your vicinity. Your goal is to determine whether a carryall should be sent for rescue, or if it must be forfeited because there is not enough time.\n\nEach test input will consist of an object `data`, which has the following properties:\n\n`harvester`: location of the spice harvester\n\n`worm`: location and travel speed of the spotted sandworm in the form `[location, movement speed]`)\n\n`carryall`: location and travel speed of the nearest carryall in the form `[location, movement speed]`)\n\nConditions / Restrictions:\n==========================\n- All coordinates (`location`) are in the form: `[x, y]` and may be positive or negative. For example: `[45,225]`\n- Assume that the sandworm and Carryall each are moving toward the harvester in a straight line at a constant speed.\n- A Carryall takes 1 minute to lift the harvester to a safe altitude in order to avoid being devoured by the sandworm. Take this into account when formulating your solution.\n- Distance is measured in kilometers (*in the 213th century, the metric system is the universal standard*)\n- Movement speed is measured in km/minute.\n- Input argument is always valid.\n- Return value should be a `String` type value.\n- Do not mutate the input.\n\nOutput:\n=======\n\nIf the harvester can be saved (that is, lifted to a safe altitude *before* the sandworm reaches the target location), the function should return `The spice must flow! Rescue the harvester!` otherwise, it should return `Damn the spice! I'll rescue the miners!`\n\nTest Example:\n=============\n```javascript\nlet data1 = {harvester: [345,600], worm: [[200,100],25], carryall: [[350,200],32]};\n\nharvesterRescue(data1); // returns 'The spice must flow! Rescue the harvester!'\n```\n```python\ndata1 = {'harvester': [345,600], 'worm': [[200,100],25], 'carryall': [[350,200],32]}\n\nharvester_rescue(data1); # returns 'The spice must flow! Rescue the harvester!'\n```\n```java\n// Harvester Position, Worm Position&Speed, Carryall Position&Speed\ndata = {{345, 600}, {200, 100, 25}, {350, 200, 32}}\n\nharvester_rescue(data); // Returns \"The spice must flow! Rescue the harvester!\"\n```\n```elixir\n# in Elixir you will be given a keyword list\ndata1 = [harvester: [345,600], worm: [[200,100],25], carryall: [[350,200],32]]\n\nSave.harvester_rescue(data1) # returns \"The spice must flow! Rescue the harvester!\"\n```\n```go\n// For Go, you'll be given a preloaded Data struct:\n\ntype Data struct {\n\tHarvester [2]int\n\tWorm [3]int\n\tCarryall [3]int\n}\n\ndata1 := Data{[2]int{345,600}, [3]int{200,100,25}, [3]int{350,200,32}}\n\nHarvesterRescue(data1) // returns \"The spice must flow! Rescue the harvester!\"\n```\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata, be sure to check out [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/docgunthrop/authored).",

Description is not easy to understand, for example:\n ```\n arr1=[5,4,3,2,1], \n arr2=[6,5,7,8,9]\n ```\n Let us try to sorting arr1. \n First, we need know the ascending order of arr2:\n ```\n [5,6,7,8,9]\n ```\n We can see, after sorting arr2 to ascending order, some elements' index are changed:\n ```\n unsort arr2      ascending order arr2\n [6,5,7,8,9]--->      [5,6,7,8,9]\n \n index0(6)  --->      index1\n index1(5)  --->      index0\n index2(7)            index2(no change)\n index3(8)            index3(no change)\n index4(9)            index4(no change)\n ```\n So, we need to sort arr1 according to these changes:\n ```\n unsort arr1          sorted arr1\n [5,4,3,2,1]--->      [4,5,3,2,1]\n \n index0(5)  --->      index1\n index1(4)  --->      index0\n index2(3)            index2(no change)\n index3(2)            index3(no change)\n index4(1)            index4(no change)\n \n So: sorted arr1= [4,5,3,2,1]\n ```\n And then, we're sorting arr2 with the same process:\n ```\n unsort arr1      ascending order arr1\n [5,4,3,2,1]--->      [1,2,3,4,5]\n \n index0(5)  --->      index4\n index1(4)  --->      index3\n index2(3)            index2(no change)\n index3(2)  --->      index1\n index4(1)  --->      index0\n \n unsort arr2          sorted arr2\n [6,5,7,8,9]--->      [9,8,7,5,6]\n \n index0(6)  --->      index4\n index1(5)  --->      index3\n index2(7)            index2(no change)\n index3(8)  --->      index1\n index4(9)  --->      index0\n \n So: sorted arr2= [9,8,7,5,6]\n \n ```\n Finally, return sorted arrays as a 2D array: `[sorted arr1, sorted arr2]`\n \n Note: In ascending order sorting process(not the final sort), if some elements have same value, sort them according to their index; You can modify the original array, but I advise you not to do that. ;-)\n\n```if:haskell\n Note: In Haskell, you are expected to return a tuple of arrays, and good luck trying to modifiy the original array. :]\n```\n```if:cobol\n Note: In COBOL, use the two tables `result1` and `result2` for the result.\n```\n# Some Examples and explain\n\n```\nsortArrays([5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,7,8,9]) should return\n[[4,5,3,2,1],[9,8,7,5,6]]\n\nsortArrays([2,1,3,4,5],[5,6,7,8,9]) should return\n[[2,1,3,4,5],[6,5,7,8,9]]\n\nsortArrays([5,6,9,2,6,5],[3,6,7,4,8,1]) should return\n[[5,5,2,6,9,6],[4,3,1,6,8,7]]\n```\n",

        "description": "Todd is looking for the best place to park in the grocery store parking lot. Todd knows that there's a sequence of events that happens whenever he buys groceries:\n\n  * When he first arrives, he walks straight into the store (where the carts are kept).  \n  * After completing shopping, he will return to his car with his cart to put the groceries away.  \n  * He will walk with the now empty cart to the nearest cart corral, and deposit it.  \n  * He will walk back to his car.\n\nThis particular parking lot is fairly simple. The store is located on the far left, there is a single row of parking, with some number of cart corrals interspersed within them. For example:\n\n```python\n[\"STORE\", \"TAKEN\", \"TAKEN\", \"CORRAL\", \"TAKEN\", \"OPEN\", \"OPEN\", \"TAKEN\", \"CORRAL\"]\n```\n```javascript\n[\"STORE\", \"TAKEN\", \"TAKEN\", \"CORRAL\", \"TAKEN\", \"OPEN\", \"OPEN\", \"TAKEN\", \"CORRAL\"]\n```\n```haskell\n[ STORE, TAKEN, TAKEN, CORRAL, TAKEN, OPEN, OPEN, TAKEN, CORRAL ]\n```\n\nEach index is one \"space\" of walking.\n\nIn this case, the best spot for Todd would be at index 5. He would take 5 steps to get to the store, then 5 steps to get back to his car, then 2 steps to get to a cart corral, then 2 steps to get back, for a total of 14 steps.\n\nReturn the index of the parking spot Todd should choose. Since Todd is driving in from the side without the store on it, if there's a tie in distance, pick the one that's the furthest from the store. (Less driving. Todd is incredibly lazy.)",

        "description": "#About Caesar Cipher\n\nCaesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique based on shifting each character by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.\n\nFor example, if the shift is 3, an encoded version of phrase \"kata\" will be:\n```\nk + 3 = n\na + 3 = d\nt + 3 = w\na + 3 = d\n```\nIn a case when \"z\" is reached, the algorithm wraps back to \"a\".\nExample: \"zen\", key 3\n```\nz + 3 = c\ne + 3 = h\nn + 3 = q\n```\nThe key for this cipher can be any non-negative integer. However, because there are 26 letters in English alphabet, any key larger than 26 can be thought about as key = key % 26.\n\n#What to do\n\nYour task is to write a function that will *encrypt* a phrase using Caesar Cipher and a given shift key and return it as a string. However, **the key should be increased by 1 with every word in a phrase**. For example, if the function is called with a phrase \"divide et impera\" and key 3, the encoding should be as follows:\n```\n- Shift the word \"divide\" by the key of 3\n- Shift the word \"et\" by the key of 3 + 1 = 4\n- Shift the word \"impera\" by the key of 3 + 2 = 5\n```\n\n\n#Important things to note:\n- Guaranteed input will be of type string, **lowercase characters and spaces only**.\n- Key can be any non-negative integer.\n\nTo read more about Caesar Cipher, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher",

All potions have some color that written down as RGB color from `[0, 0, 0]` to `[255, 255, 255]`. To make task more complicated teacher will do few mixing and after will ask you for final color. Besides color you also need to figure out what volume will have potion after final mix.\n\n## Task\n\nBased on your programming background you managed to figure that after mixing two potions colors will mix as if mix two RGB colors. For example, if you'll mix potion that have color `[255, 255, 0]` and volume `10` with one that have color `[0, 254, 0]` and volume `5`, you'll get new potion with color `[170, 255, 0]` and volume `15`. So you decided to create a class `Potion` that will have two properties: `color` (a list (a tuple in Python) with 3 integers) and `volume` (a number), and one method `mix` that will accept another `Potion` and return a mixed `Potion`.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nfelix_felicis       =  Potion([255, 255, 255],  7)\nshrinking_solution  =  Potion([ 51, 102,  51], 12)\nnew_potion          =  felix_felicis.mix(shrinking_solution)\n\nnew_potion.color   ==  [127, 159, 127]\nnew_potion.volume  ==  19\n```\n\n**Note**: Use ceiling when calculating the resulting potion's color.",

No advertising, no difference between their products. \n\nEmily and Danny can put their stall on any point in the town square, which is a five by five grid, with x and y coordinates. And is laid out like this:\n<br>\n```\n               (-2, 2)  (-1, 2)  (0, 2)  (1, 2)  (2, 2)\n               (-2, 1)  (-1, 1)  (0, 1)  (1, 1)  (2, 1)\n               (-2, 0)  (-1, 0)  (0, 0)  (1, 0)  (2, 0)\n               (-2,-1)  (-1,-1)  (0,-1)  (1,-1)  (2,-1)\n               (-2,-2)  (-1,-2)  (0,-2)  (1,-2)  (2,-2)\n\n```\nTheir customers only care about one thing: walking the shortest distance to the stall. If the two shops are equal distance from their starting point, half will go to one, half go to the other. \n<br><br>\nPeople will come from any point on the edge and in equal amounts from each point ( to save time I've put the coordinates are at the *bottom of the page*). They can **only** move horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. E.g. going from (1,1) to (0,0) takes two steps, not one.  <br>\n\n### Task: \nDanny gets to pick his coordinates first, Emily picks second. <br>\n        Write a function that takes Danny\u2019s coordinates and returns the coordinates where Emily will get the most customers.\n\n### Format:\nDanny's choice will be given as coordinates [x, y] in an array e.g. ``` [2, 2] ```. <br> \nAnswers for Emily should be given in a nested array ``` [[-2, 1]]```. \nIf there is more than one answer you should list all possible pitches in a nested array e.g.``` [[2, 2],[2, 1]]```.  <br> <br>\nThe pitches should be in order from lowest x coordinate to highest, any with the same x coordinates should be from lowest y coordinate to highest:\n <br> e.g. ```[[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]``` <br>                                             not: ```[[2,1],[2,2],[1,1]]``` \n<br><br>\nIf Danny picks coordinates off the grid  e.g. ``` [3,1] ``` you should return the centre coordinate to spread the walking distance equally ```[[0,0]]```. <br>  \nEnjoy!\n<br>\n```javascript\n     allEntranceCoordinates = [[2,2,],[1,2],[0,2],[-1,2],[-2,2],[-2,1],\n     [-2,0],[-2,-1],[-2,-2],[-1,-2],[0,-2],[1,-2],[2,-2],[2,-1],[2,0],\n     [2,1]];\n\n```\n\n                                          \n\n\n",

For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on...\n\nBut at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work.\n\nTo avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in.\n\n# Kata Task\n\nGiven the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted.\n\n# Example\n\nFor ```start``` = 125, and ```end``` = 132\n\nThe letterboxes are\n* 125 = ```1```, ```2```, ```5```\n* 126 = ```1```, ```2```, ```6```\n* 127 = ```1```, ```2```, ```7```\n* 128 = ```1```, ```2```, ```8```\n* 129 = ```1```, ```2```, ```9```\n* 130 = ```1```, ```3```, ```0```\n* 131 = ```1```, ```3```, ```1```\n* 132 = ```1```, ```3```, ```2```\n\nThe digit frequencies are:\n* `0` is painted <span style='color:red;'>1</span> time\n* `1` is painted <span style='color:red;'>9</span> times\n* `2` is painted <span style='color:red;'>6</span> times\n* etc...\n\nand so the method would return ```[1,9,6,3,0,1,1,1,1,1]```\n\n# Notes\n\n* 0 < ```start``` <= ```end```\n* In C, the returned value will be free'd.\n",

You also know that John is a magic frog: he is afraid of water, so he can cross the lake only by stones. Luckily, he can understand your words. Can you help him to get to the other side of lake?\n\n You are given an array with coordinates of the stones ahead of John. Initially John is standing on a stone with coordinate `0`. If he stands on a stone with coordinate `x`, he can jump to the stones with coordinates `x + 1` (make a short jump), or `x + 2` (make a long jump).\n\n Find the shortest path to the other side (to the last stone) and return the sequence of `'1's` and `'2's`, where `'1'` is a short jump and `'2'` is a long one. If there are several answers, return lexicographically smallest.\n\n String A is lexicographically smaller than string B either if A is a prefix of B (and A \u2260 B), or if there exists such index i (0 \u2264 i < min(x.length, y.length)), that Ai < Bi, and for any j (0 \u2264 j < i) Aj = Bj.

        "description": "On fictional islands of Matunga archipelage several different tribes use fictional currency - tung. One tung is a very small amount, so all payments are made with coins of different values. For example, one tribe use coins of 7 and 9 tungs, another - 6, 10 and 11 tungs. Every tribe has at least 2 different coins.\nAlso every tribe has a shop with remarkable feature: if you find an item N tungs worth, you always can find an item priced N+1 tungs in the same shop.\nYour goal is to write the function min_price(coins) which finds out the minimum price of item which can be in sale in Matunga tribe shop, knowing the values of coins used there.\n\nFunction should return -1 if result is not accessible (i.e. coins of these values can't cover natural row from N to infinity without gaps).\n\nFor example, some tribe has coins of 3 and 5 tungs. They can't sell items of 4 or 7 tungs, because 4 and 7 can't be represented as a sum of 3's and 5's. But starting from 8 tungs you can do it with every sum: 8 is 5+3, 9 is 3+3+3, 10 is 5+5, 11 is 5+3+3 and so on. So the answer for this set of coins is 8.\n\n",

Since you are not sure which formula to use and you are feeling confident, your function will return the largest value from the three formulas shown above, rounded to the nearest integer. However, if the number of repetitions passed in is `1` (i.e., it is already a one rep max), your function must return `w`. Also, if the number of repetitions passed in is `0` (i.e., no repetitions were completed), your function must return `0`.\n\n```if:rust\n**Note:** due to a loss of precision, it is advisable to use `f64` and not `f32`.\n```\n",

        "description": "In this challenge, we'll be learning about the pseudocode `Display` command, and how to translate it to Python. The pseudocode standard used in this challenge is based on the book [Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design, 3rd Edition](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/product?ISBN=0132805456) by Tony Gaddis. If you want to test code that uses x_print (described below) in Python 3 outside of the CodeWars site, add this line to the top of the code:\n```\nx_print = print\n```\n\n# Python 2.7 and Codewars\nFirst, it's important to note that the Codewars site uses Python 2.7, which is an older version. One of the important differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 is that the `print` statement is different. \n\nIn Python 2.7, `print` is called like this:\n```\n#  Display \"Hello World!\"\nprint \"Hello World!\"\n```\nThe `print` statement takes a single String argument. If you want to `print` multiple values, you need to either use multiple `print` statements (one per each line of output), or you need to create a single String from the values you want to `print` and `print` that single String (you can use the String concatenation operator `+` to do that). For example:\n```\n#  Declare String student_name = \"Fred\"\n#  Declare String course_name = \"Software Design\"\n#\n#  Display \"Hello\", student_name, \", welcome to\", course_name, \"!\"\n\nstudent_name = \"Fred\"\ncourse_name = \"Software Design\"\n\nprint \"Hello \" + student_name + \", wecome to \" + course_name + \"!\"\n```\nThe output from running this program will be: \n```\nHello Fred, wecome to Software Design!\n```\nNote the use of spaces inside the strings `\"Hello \"` and `\", welcome to \"` so that the resulting line is formatted correctly. \n\nConverting the output to a single String becomes a little more complicated when you want to print numbers, because the following code produces an error:\n```\n#  Declare String assignment = \"Exam 1\"\n#  Declare Real score = 85.5\n#\n#  Display \"Your grade on\", assignment, \"was\", score\n\nassignment = \"Exam 1\"\nscore = 85.5\n\nprint \"Your grade on \" + assignment + \" was \" + score\n```\nThe text of the error is:\n```\nTypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'float' objects\n```\nThe reason for the error is that only Strings can be concatenated with other Strings, and Reals (floats in Python) are not Strings. The value of `score` is the Real number 85.5, not the String \"85.5\". To fix that, we need to convert the Real to a String ourselves, using the `str` function in Python:\n```\n#  Declare String assignment = \"Exam 1\"\n#  Declare Real score = 85.5\n#\n#  Display \"Your grade on\", assignment, \"was\", score\n\nassignment = \"Exam 1\"\nscore = 85.5\n\nprint \"Your grade on \" + assignment + \" was \" + str(score)\n```\nNote that we don't need to put the call to `str` in our pseudocode, that's just a detail of our Python implementation.\n\nThis version of the program should produce the following output in Python 2.7:\n```\nYour grade on Exam 1 was 85.5\n```\n# Python 3\nIn Python 3, `print` is called like this:\n```\n#  Display \"Hello World!\"\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\nThe `print` statement takes multiple arguments within the `(...)`. If you want to `print` multiple values, you can include them all in a single print statement, separated by commas like `print(a, b, c, ..., n)`. For example:\n```\n#  Declare String student_name = \"Fred\"\n#  Declare String course_name = \"Software Design\"\n#\n#  Display \"Hello\", student_name, \", welcome to\", course_name, \"!\"\n\nstudent_name = \"Fred\"\ncourse_name = \"Software Design\"\n\nprint(\"Hello\", student_name, \", wecome to\" + course_name + \"!\")\n```\nThe output from running this program will be: \n```\nHello Fred , wecome to Software Design !\n```\nNote that Python prints each argument in order, separated by a single space (\" \"). You can control what text the `print` command uses to separate values by supplying a `sep` argument, like this:\n```\n#  Declare String student_name = \"Fred\"\n#  Declare String course_name = \"Software Design\"\n#\n#  Display \"Hello\", student_name, \", welcome to\", course_name, \"!\"\n\nstudent_name = \"Fred\"\ncourse_name = \"Software Design\"\n\nprint(\"Hello \", student_name, \", wecome to \" + course_name + \"!\", sep=\"\")\n```\nThe output from running this program will be: \n```\nHello Fred, wecome to Software Design!\n```\nWith Python 3 print, each argument is automatically converted to a String, so there's no need to use the `str` function. This code should work properly:\n```\n#  Declare String assignment = \"Exam 1\"\n#  Declare Real score = 85.5\n#\n#  Display \"Your grade on\", assignment, \"was\", score\n\nassignment = \"Exam 1\"\nscore = 85.5\n\nprint(\"Your grade on\", assignment, \"was\", score)\n```\nThis version of the program should produce the following output in Python 3:\n```\nYour grade on Exam 1 was 85.5\n```\nWhen you `print` text, each `print` statement will add one line of output to the display by default. It does this by automatically adding a linefeed character to the end of the output (in Python, the linefeed character is represented as \"\\n\"). You can change this behavior by specifying a different value for the `end` argument like this:\n```\nprint(\"Hello\", end=\" \")\nprint(\"World!\")\n```\nSince the end-of-line string has been changed to a single space in the first print statement, the output displays as:\n```\nHello World!\n```\n# x_print\nSince `print` on Codewars is the Python 2.7 version of `print`, but we want to get practice with the Python 3 version, I have included a command called `x_print`. It works the same way as the print command works in Python 3. Use it like this:\n```\n#  Declare String assignment = \"Exam 1\"\n#  Declare Real score = 85.5\n#\n#  Display \"Your grade on\", assignment, \"was\", score\n\nassignment = \"Exam 1\"\nscore = 85.5\n\nx_print(\"Your grade on\", assignment, \"was\", score)\n```\n# Challenge\nTo complete this challenge, supply both the Python 2.7 and Python 3 translations (using `x_print` for the Python 3 version) for the pseudocode provided in the comments.\n\n",

Below is the breakdown:\n\nApple varieties are represented with numbers, `1 to 7`\n\nA fruit package is represented with a 2 element array `[4,3]`\n\nA fruit package with one bad apple, or a bad package, is represented with `[2,0]` or `[0,2]`\n\nA fruit package with two bad apples, or a rotten package, is represented with `[0,0]`\n\nA fruit box is represented with:\n\n```\n[ [ 1, 3 ],\n  [ 7, 6 ],\n  [ 7, 2 ],\n  [ 1, 3 ],\n  [ 0, 2 ],\n  [ 4, 5 ],\n  [ 0, 3 ],\n  [ 7, 6 ] ]\n\n```\n\nWrite a program to clear the fruit box off bad apples. \n\nThe INPUT will be a fruit box represented with a 2D array: `[[1,3],[7,6],[7,2],[1,3],[0,2],[4,5],[0,3],[7,6]]`\n\nThe OUTPUT should be the fruit box void of bad apples: `[[1,3],[7,6],[7,2],[1,3],[2,3],[4,5],[7,6]]`\n\nConditions to be met:\n\n1.A bad package should have the bad apple replaced if there is another bad package with a good apple to spare. Else, the bad package should be discarded.\n\n2.The order of the packages in the fruit box should be preserved. Repackaging happens from the top of the fruit box `index = 0` to the bottom `nth index`. Also note how fruits in a package are ordered when repacking. Example shown in INPUT/OUPUT above.\n\n3.Rotten packages should be discarded. \n\n4.There can be packages with the same variety of apples, e.g `[1,1]`, this is not a problem. ",

        "description": "In this kata you must determine the lowest floor in a building from which you cannot drop an egg without it breaking. You may assume that all eggs are the same; if one egg breaks when dropped from floor `n`, all eggs will. If an egg survives a drop from some floor, it will survive a drop from any floor below too. \r\n\r\nYou are given `num_eggs` eggs and are allowed to make a maximum of `num_drops` drops. If an egg does not break when dropped, it may be reused. You may assume that it is feasible to determine the floor with the given number of eggs and drops.\r\n\r\nExample 1: \r\nYou are given 1 egg and 10 drops. You start by dropping the egg from the first floor (floor numbering starts at 1). If it breaks, the answer is 1. If it does not break, you drop it from the second floor. If it breaks, the answer is 2. Otherwise you continue in the same manner until you reach a floor where the egg breaks. You may assume that you will reach that floor before you have exhausted your drops (i.e., in this example, the egg will break when dropped from floor 10 or lower).\r\n\r\nExample 2: You are given 2 eggs and 10 drops. The highest floor for which this problem has a solution is floor 55, so you may assume that the answer is floor 55 or a lower floor. You will have to determine how the number 55 is derived and generalize it for any number of eggs and drops.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, you need to write a function `solve` that takes an argument `emulator` and returns the lowest floor from which an egg will break if dropped. The `emulator` object has the following properties and method which you may invoke:\r\n\r\n  1. `emulator.eggs` returns the number of eggs you have left. You may use this property to detemine the number of eggs you are given initially.\r\n  2. `emulator.drops` returns the the number of drops you have left. You may use this property to detemine the number of drops you are given initially.\r\n  3. `emulator.drop(n)` returns `True` if an egg dropped from floor `n` breaks and `False` if it does not break. The number of times that you may invoke this method is limited to the number of drops you were given. If invoked after no drops are left, it will throw an exception. Same happens if you invoke this method after all your eggs are broken. \r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to access any other method or state attribute of the `emulator` object, even if you can. This is considered cheating and is a very dishonorable thing to do! Note that `emulator.__dict__` has been disabled. \r\n\r\nNote: [This kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/faberge-easter-eggs-crush-test) is similar although not the same.\r\n",

It depends on how long you need it(I can't offer it as a argument, it only exists in your imagination) ;-)\n \n Your task is complete function `findPosition` that accept a digital string `num`. Returns the position(index) of the digital string(the first appearance).\n \n For example:\n ```\n findPosition(\"456\") == 3\n because \"123456789101112131415\".indexOf(\"456\") = 3\n             ^^^\n ```\n Is it simple? No, It is more difficult than you think ;-) \n ```\n findPosition(\"454\") = ?\n Oh, no! There is no \"454\" in \"123456789101112131415\",\n so we should return -1?\n No, I said, this is a string of infinite length.\n We need to increase the length of the string to find \"454\"\n \n findPosition(\"454\") == 79\n because \"123456789101112131415...44454647\".indexOf(\"454\")=79\n                                    ^^^\n ```\n The length of argument `num` is 2 to 15. So now there are two ways: one is to create a huge own string to find the index position; Or thinking about an algorithm to calculate the index position. \n \n Which way would you choose? ;-)\n \n### Some examples:\n\n```\n findPosition(\"456\") == 3\n (\"...3456...\")\n       ^^^\n findPosition(\"454\") == 79\n (\"...444546...\")\n        ^^^\n findPosition(\"455\") == 98\n (\"...545556...\")\n       ^^^\n findPosition(\"910\") == 8\n (\"...7891011...\")\n        ^^^\n findPosition(\"9100\") == 188\n (\"...9899100101...\")\n         ^^^^\n findPosition(\"99100\") == 187\n (\"...9899100101...\")\n        ^^^^^\n findPosition(\"00101\") == 190\n (\"...99100101...\")\n         ^^^^^\n findPosition(\"001\") == 190\n (\"...9899100101...\")\n           ^^^\n findPosition(\"123456789\") == 0\n findPosition(\"1234567891\") == 0\n findPosition(\"123456798\") == 1000000071\n```\nA bit difficulty, A bit of fun, happy coding ;-)",

(He also suggests to research the problem using the keywords in the tags)\n\n__(Be aware that if your algorithm is not efficient, it will attempt to look at 2^49 = 562949953421312 nodes instead of 49^2 = 2401... The solution will automatically fail if it takes longer than 6 seconds... which occurs at right around Log 23)__",

The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n- In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\nEvery run has these rules:\n- You start at the first number (from the direction).\n- Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n  this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n- If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n  for the new array and continue with the next number.\n- If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n  elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n  Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n- Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n  For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n  The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n```\n\nSounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...\nMaybe an example will help.\n\n```\n Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n \nSteps: \nFirst run: (start from left side!)\n1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n   So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\nSecond run: (start from right side!)\n1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n   take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n   new array.\n2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n   than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n```\n\nThe given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.\n\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.",

        "description": "## Task\n\nYou will create an interpreter which takes inputs described below and produces outputs, storing state in between each input.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start with this kata, check out my [Simpler Interactive Interpreter](http://www.codewars.com/dojo/katas/53005a7b26d12be55c000243) kata, which greatly simplifies the interpreter by removing functions.\n\n**Note that the** `eval` **command has been disabled.**\n\n## Concepts\n\nThe interpreter will take inputs in the language described under the language header below. This section will give an overview of the language constructs.\n\n### Variables\n\nAny `identifier` which is not a keyword or a function name will be treated as a variable. If the identifier is on the left hand side of an assignment operator, the result of the right hand side will be stored in the variable. If a variable occurs as part of an expression, the value held in the variable will be substituted when the expression is evaluated.\n\nVariables are implicitly declared the first time they are assigned to.\n\n**Example:** Initializing a variable to a constant value and using the variable in another expression (Each line starting with a '>' indicates a separate call to the input method of the interpreter, other lines represent output)\n\n```\n>x = 7\n    7\n>x + 6\n    13\t\n```\n\nReferencing a non-existent variable will cause the interpreter to throw an error. The interpreter should be able to continue accepting input even after throwing.\n\n**Example:** Referencing a non-existent variable\n\n```\n>y + 7\n    ERROR: Invalid identifier. No variable with name 'y' was found.\"\n```\n\n### Assignments\n\nAn assignment is an expression that has an identifier on left side of an `=` operator, and any expression on the right. Such expressions should store the value of the right hand side in the specified variable and return the result.\n\n**Example:** Assigning a constant to a variable\n\n```\nx = 7\n    7\n```\n\nYou should also be able to chain and nest assignments. Note that the assignment operator is one of the few that is right associative.\n\n**Example:** Chained assignments. The statement below should set both `x` and `y` to `7`.\n\n```\nx = y = 7\n    7\n```\n\n**Example:** Nested assignments. The statement below should set `y` to `3`, but it only outputs the final result.\n\n```\nx = 13 + (y = 3)\n    16\n```\n\n### Operator Precedence\n\nOperator precedence will follow the common order. There is a table in the *Language* section below that explicitly states the operators and their relative precedence.\n\n### Functions\n\nFunctions are declared by the `fn` keyword followed by a name, an optional arguments list, the `=>` operator, and finally an expression. All function variables are local to the function. That is, the only variable names allowed in the function body are those declared by the arguments list. If a function has an argument called 'x', and there is also a global variable called 'x', the function should use the value of the supplied argument, not the value of the global variable, when evaluating the expression. References to variables not found in the argument list should result in an error when the function is defined.\n\n**Example:** declare a function to calculate the average of two variables and call it. (Each line starting with a '>' indicates a separate call to the input method of the interpreter, other lines represent output)\n\n```\n>fn avg => (x + y) / 2\n    ERROR: Unknown identifier 'x'\n>fn avg x y => (x + y) / 2\n>a = 2\n    2\n>b = 4\n    4\n>avg a b\n    3 \n```\n\n**Example:** declare a function with an invalid variable name in the function body\n\n```\n>fn add x y => x + z\n    ERROR: Invalid identifier 'z' in function body.\n```\n\n**Example:** chain method calls (hint: function calls are right associative!)\n\n```\n>fn echo x => x\n>fn add x y => x + y\n>add echo 4 echo 3\n    7\n```\n\n### Name conflicts\n\nBecause variable and function names share the same grammar, conflicts are possible. Precedence will be given to the first object declared. That is, if a variable is declared, then subsequent declaration of a function with the same name should result in an error. Likewise, declaration of a function followed by the initialization of a variable with the same name should result in an error.\n\nDeclaration of function with the same name as an existing function should overwrite the old function with the new one.\n\n**Example:** Overwriting a function\n\n```\n>fn inc x => x + 1\n>a = 0\n    0\n>a = inc a\n    1\n>fn inc x => x + 2\n>a = inc a\n    3\n```\n\n### Input\n\nInput will conform to either the `function` production or the `expression` production in the grammar below.\n\n\n### Output\n\n* Output for a valid function declaration will be an empty string (null in Java).\n* Output for a valid expression will be the result of the expression.\n* Output for input consisting entirely of whitespace will be an empty string (null in Java).\n* All other cases will throw an error.\n\n```haskell\n-- In Haskell that is:\nRight (Nothing, Interpreter)\nRight (Just Double, Interpreter) \nRight (Nothing, Interpreter)\nLeft String\n```\n```rust\n// In Rust that is:\nOk(None)\nOk(Some(f32))\nOk(None)\nErr(String)\n```\n\n## Language\n\n### Grammar\n\nThis section specifies the grammar for the interpreter language in [EBNF syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form)\n\n```\nfunction        ::= fn-keyword fn-name { identifier } fn-operator expression\nfn-name         ::= identifier\nfn-operator     ::= '=>'\nfn-keyword      ::= 'fn'\n\nexpression      ::= factor | expression operator expression\nfactor          ::= number | identifier | assignment | '(' expression ')' | function-call\nassignment      ::= identifier '=' expression\nfunction-call   ::= fn-name { expression }\n\noperator        ::= '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '%'\n\nidentifier      ::= letter | '_' { identifier-char }\nidentifier-char ::= '_' | letter | digit\n\nnumber          ::= { digit } [ '.' digit { digit } ]\n\nletter          ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'y' | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Y' | 'Z'\ndigit           ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'\n```\n\n### Operator Precedence\n\nThe following table lists the language's operators grouped in order of precedence. Operators within each group have equal precedence.\n\nCategory  | Operators\n------------- | -------------\nMultiplicative  | *, /, %\nAdditive  | +, -\nAssignment | =\nFunction | =>\n\n### Division\n\nYou should use float division instead of integer division.",

This section will give an overview of the language constructs.\n\n### Variables\n\nAny `identifier` which is not a keyword will be treated as a variable. If the identifier is on the left hand side of an assignment operator, the result of the right hand side will be stored in the variable. If a variable occurs as part of an expression, the value held in the variable will be substituted when the expression is evaluated.\n\nVariables are implicitly declared the first time they are assigned to.\n\n**Example:** Initializing a variable to a constant value and using the variable in another expression (Each line starting with a '>' indicates a separate call to the input method of the interpreter, other lines represent output)\n\n```\n>x = 7\n    7\n>x + 6\n    13\t\n```\n\nReferencing a non-existent variable will cause the interpreter to throw an error. The interpreter should be able to continue accepting input even after throwing.\n\n**Example:** Referencing a non-existent variable\n\n```\n>y + 7\n    ERROR: Invalid identifier. No variable with name 'y' was found.\"\n```\n\n### Assignments\n\nAn assignment is an expression that has an identifier on left side of an `=` operator, and any expression on the right. Such expressions should store the value of the right hand side in the specified variable and return the result.\n\n**Example:** Assigning a constant to a variable\n\n```\nx = 7\n    7\n```\n\nIn this kata, all tests will contain only a single assignment. You do not need to consider chained or nested assignments.\n\n### Operator Precedence\n\nOperator precedence will follow the common order. There is a table in the *Language* section below that explicitly states the operators and their relative precedence.\n\n### Name conflicts\n\nBecause variables are declared implicitly, no naming conflicts are possible. variable assignment will always overwrite any existing value.\n\n### Input\n\nInput will conform to the `expression` production in the grammar below.\n\n\n### Output\n\nOutput for a valid expression will be the result of the expression.\n\nOutput for input consisting entirely of whitespace will be an empty string (`null` in case of Java).\n\nAll other cases will throw an error.\n\n## Language\n\n### Grammar\n\nThis section specifies the grammar for the interpreter language in [EBNF syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form)\n\n```\nexpression      ::= factor | expression operator expression\nfactor          ::= number | identifier | assignment | '(' expression ')'\nassignment      ::= identifier '=' expression\n\noperator        ::= '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '%'\n\nidentifier      ::= letter | '_' { identifier-char }\nidentifier-char ::= '_' | letter | digit\n\nnumber          ::= { digit } [ '.' digit { digit } ]\n\nletter          ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'y' | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Y' | 'Z'\ndigit           ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'\n```\n\n### Operator Precedence\n\nThe following table lists the language's operators grouped in order of precedence. Operators within each group have equal precedence.\n\nCategory  | Operators\n------------- | -------------\nMultiplicative  | *, /, %\nAdditive  | +, -\nAssignment | =\n",

Each player makes the best poker hand possible using five of the seven available cards (community cards + the player's hole cards). \n\nPossible hands are, in descending order of value:\n\n1. Straight-flush (five consecutive ranks of the same suit). Higher rank is better.\n2. Four-of-a-kind (four cards with the same rank). Tiebreaker is first the rank, then the rank of the remaining card.\n3. Full house (three cards with the same rank, two with another). Tiebreaker is first the rank of the three cards, then rank of the pair.\n4. Flush (five cards of the same suit). Higher ranks are better, compared from high to low rank.\n5. Straight (five consecutive ranks). Higher rank is better.\n6. Three-of-a-kind (three cards of the same rank). Tiebreaker is first the rank of the three cards, then the highest other rank, then the second highest other rank.\n7. Two pair (two cards of the same rank, two cards of another rank). Tiebreaker is first the rank of the high pair, then the rank of the low pair and then the rank of the remaining card.\n8. Pair (two cards of the same rank). Tiebreaker is first the rank of the two cards, then the three other ranks.\n9. Nothing.

        "description": "# The Challenge\n\nYou'll need to implement a simple lexer type `Simplexer`, which, when constructed with a given string containing an expression in a simple language, transforms that string into a stream of `Token`s.\n\n## Simplexer\n\nYour `Simplexer` type is created with the expression it should tokenize. It should act like an iterator, yielding `Token` items until there are no more items to yield, at which point it should do whatever the appropriate action is for your chosen language.\n\n~~~if:python\nInstances of the `Simplexer` class are initialized with a string and should be iterators as well as iterable, i.e. they must implement both `__iter__` and `__next__`.\n\nLike all iterators, `__next__` should raise a `StopIteration` exception when no more tokens remain to be yielded.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:java\nObjects of the `Simplexer` class are instantiated with a string and should implement the `Iterator<Token>` interface, meaning the `Simplexer` class must define the `Token next()` and the `boolean hasNext()` methods.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:javascript\nObjects of the `Simplexer` class are instantiated with a string and must define the `next(): Token` and the `hasNext(): boolean` methods.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:csharp\nObjects of the `Simplexer` class are instantiated with a string and are `Iterator<T>`, which is an extension of `IEnumerator<T>` with default implementations for `Reset()`, `Dispose()` and `IEnumerator.Current`. You only need to override `MoveNext()` and `Current { get; }`.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:rust\nThe `Simplexer` type must define a `new` function which takes a string and returns an instance of itself. It must also implement `Iterator<Item = Token>`.\n~~~\n\n## Tokens\n\nTokens are represented by `Token` objects, **which are preloaded** for you and take the following shape:\n\n~~~if:java\n```java\npublic class Token {\n\n    public final String text;\n    public final String type;\n\n    public Token(String text, String type) {\n        this.text = text;\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n}\n```\n- `Token.text` is the value of the matched portion of the expression\n- `Token.type` is the type of the token (see below)\n~~~\n\n~~~if:python\n```python\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, text: str, kind: str):\n      self.text = text\n      self.kind = kind\n```\n- `Token.text` is the value of the matched portion of the expression\n- `Token.kind` is the type of the token (see below)\n~~~\n\n~~~if:javascript\n```javascript\nfunction Token(text, type) {\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'text', {\n        enumerable: true,\n        value: text\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(this, 'type', {\n        enumerable: true,\n        value: type\n    });\n};\n```\n- `text` is a string, the matched portion of the expression\n- `type` is a string representing the token type (see below)\n~~~\n\n~~~if:csharp\n```csharp\nclass Token\n{\n    private string text { get; }\n    private string type { get; }\n\n    public Token(string text, string type)\n    {\n        this.text = text;\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n}\n```\n- `Token.text` is the value of the matched portion of the expression\n- `Token.type` is the type of the token (see below)\n~~~\n\n~~~if:rust\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Token {\n    pub text: String,\n    pub kind: TokenKind,\n}\n\nimpl Token {\n    pub fn new(text: &str, kind: TokenKind) -> Self\n}\n\npub enum TokenKind {\n    Integer,\n    Boolean,\n    String,\n    Operator,\n    Keyword,\n    Whitespace,\n    Identifier,\n}\n```\n- `Token.text` is the value of the matched portion of the expression\n- `Token.kind` is a `TokenKind` variant that matches the type of the token (see below)\n\nIn addition to regular `Debug`, `Token` implements `Display` for succinct and readable output. An example would look like `Integer(\"42\")`.\n~~~\n\n\n## Language Grammar\n\nThe language for this task has a simple grammar, consisting of the following constructs and their associated token types:\n```\nType         Construct\n\ninteger:     Any sequence of one or more decimal digits (leading zeroes allowed, no negative numbers)\n\nboolean:     Any of the following words: [true, false]\n\nstring:      Any sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by \"double quotes\"\n\noperator:    Any of the following characters: [+, -, *, /, %, (, ), =]\n\nkeyword:     Any of the following words: if, else, for, while, return, func, break\n\nwhitespace:  Any sequence of the following characters: [' ', '\\t', '\\n']\n             - Consecutive whitespace should be collapsed into a single token\n\nidentifier:  Any sequence of alphanumeric characters, as well as '_' and '$'\n             - Must not start with a digit\n             - Make sure that keywords and booleans aren't matched as identifiers\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Individual constructs are disambiguated by whitespace if necessary, so\n  - `true123` is an `identifier`, as opposed to `boolean` followed by `integer`\n  - `123true` is an `integer` followed by `boolean`\n  - `\"123\"true` is a `string` followed by `boolean`\n  - `x+y` is `identifier` `op` `identifier`\n\n\n- Any character is permissable between double quotes, including keywords, numbers and arbitrary whitespace, so `\"true\"` and `\"123\"` are `string`s. The quotes `\"\"` are to be included in the Token.\n\n\n- The input strings are guaranteed to be lexically valid according to the grammar above. Specifically:\n  - Input will consist only of valid constructs that can be mapped unambiguously to one of the above tokens\n  - No assumptions need be made regarding the structure of tokens in the input, i.e. syntax.\n  - Input may be the empty string\n\n  That means the input will not contain any surprising characters, there is no need for error handling, and quotes will always appear in balanced pairs. This does *not* mean that the input needs to make semantic or syntactic sense. For example, `if 123) return else\"five\")(` is valid input for this task.\n\n  After all, the job of a lexer is not to interpret the given input, merely transform it into tokens that could then be passed on to e.g. a parser, which would then check that the tokens received are syntactically valid and imbue them with semantics.",

        "description": "Motivation\n---------\nNatural language texts often have a very high frequency of certain letters, in German for example, almost every 5th letter is an E, but only every 500th is a Q. It would then be clever to choose a very small representation for E. This is exactly what the Huffman compression is about, choosing the length of the representation based on the frequencies of the symbol in the text.\n\nAlgorithm\n--------\nLet's assume we want to encode the word `\"aaaabcc\"`, then we calculate the frequencies of the letters in the text:\n\nSymbol | Frequency\n-------|----------\na      | 4\nb      | 1\nc      | 2\n\nNow we choose a smaller representation the more often it occurs, to minimize the overall space needed. The algorithm uses a tree for encoding and decoding:\n```\n  .\n / \\\na   .\n   / \\\n   b  c\n```\nUsually we choose `0` for the left branch and `1` for the right branch (but it might also be swapped). By traversing from the root to the symbol leaf, we want to encode, we get the matching representation. To decode a sequence of binary digits into a symbol, we start from the root and just follow the path in the same way, until we reach a symbol.\n\nConsidering the above tree, we would encode **a** with `0`, **b** with `10` and **c** with `11`. Therefore encoding `\"aaaabcc\"` will result in `0000101111`.\n\n(**Note:** As you can see the encoding is not optimal, since the code for **b** and **c** have same length, but that is topic of another data compression Kata.)\n\nTree construction\n---------------\nTo build the tree, we turn each symbol into a *leaf* and sort them by their frequency. In every step, we remove 2 trees with the **smallest** frequency and put them under a node. This node gets reinserted and has the sum of the frequencies of both trees as new frequency. We are finished, when there is only 1 tree left.\n\n(**Hint:** Maybe you can do it without sorting in every step?)\n\nGoal\n----\nWrite functions `frequencies`, `encode` and `decode`.\n```if:haskell\nBits are represented as a list of `Z` (zero) and `O` (one).  \n(**Hint:** You can assume that symbols can be ordered.)\n```\n```if:javascript,python\nBits are represented as strings of `\"0\"` (zero) and `\"1\"` (one).\n```\n\n**Note:** Frequency lists with just one or less elements should get rejected. (Because then there is no information we could encode, but the length.).\n\nIf you get a frequency list with one or less elements, return `null/None/Nothing`, depending on your language.",

        "description": "This challenge is to compute a special set of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_number\">parasitic numbers</a> for various number bases.\n>An n-parasitic number (in base 10) is a positive natural number which can be multiplied by n by moving the rightmost digit of its decimal representation to the front. Here n is itself a single-digit positive natural number. In other words, the decimal representation undergoes a right circular shift by one place. For example, 4 \u2022 128205 = 512820, so 128205 is 4-parasitic\n\n## Special Parasitic Numbers\nFor some N there may be multiple N-parasitic numbers. This Kata is concerned with finding a special set of n-parasitic numbers where the trailing digit is also the 'N' in the N-parasitic number. In base-10, the above Wikipedia excerpt shows that 128205 is 4-parasitic since 4 \u2022 128205 = 512820; however, the special number this Kata is looking for is the smallest 4-parasitic number that also ends in 4, which is 102564: 4 \u2022 102564 = 410256.\n\n<blockquote>\n<h3>A Clarifying Anti-Example</h3>\nThe \"ending in N\" portion of the requirements seems easily missed. While 5 \u2022 142857 = 714285, this 142857 number is parasitic but it is <u>not</u> the number sought by this kata because it ends with a 7 in the ones' place rather than 'n' (which is 5 in this case).\n\n```\n         v--- kata requires this digit to be 5 for n = 5\n5 \u2022 142857 = 714285\n             ^--- kata requires this digit to be 5 for n = 5\n```\nWhile the product happens to end with a 5 in the one's place, that ends-with-N requirement is on the multiplicand <u>not</u> on the product. The answer sought is much bigger than 142857 for n = 5.\n</blockquote>\n\n## Challenge\nProvide a method accepting two arguments: the special trailing digit and a number base. Your method should return the string representation of the smallest integer having the special parasitic number property as described above in the requested number-base (octal, decimal and hex.) Each number base will test for all trailing digits other than 0 and 1, giving a total of 28 test cases.\n\n## Why the smallest?\nConsider how the special 4-parastic HEX number ending in 4 is 104. \n\n```104 Hex \u2022 4 = 410 Hex.```\n\nRepeating ```104``` twice and multiplying by 4 gives us ```104104 Hex \u2022 4 = 410410 Hex```. This property holds regardless of how many times the set of digits is repeated (e.g., ```104104 Hex \u2022 4 = 410410 Hex, 104104104 Hex \u2022 4 = 410410410 Hex, 104104104104 Hex \u2022 4 = 410410410410 Hex, ...```), leading to an infinite set of these special numbers in each case. Your task is to find only the smallest number that satisfies the special parasitic property. [This fact is a hint on one possible way to solve this problem.]\n\n## Hints:\n* Unless you can be clever about it, brute force techniques probably won't work.\n* An answer exists satisfying the criteria for each of the trailing-digits tested.\n* Leading zero-digits are not allowed.\n* Test failures will reveal the inputs rather than the expected value.\n\n### After you have solved it:\nCan you find two other algorithmically different approaches to solve this puzzle? The refrence solutions in JavaScript, C# and Python solve the puzzle in fundamentally different ways.\n",

The longest word will never be greater than this width.\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n  * Use spaces to fill in the gaps between words.\n  * Each line should contain as many words as possible.\n  * Use '\\n' to separate lines.\n  * Gap between words can't differ by more than one space.\n  * Lines should end with a word not a space.\n  * '\\n' is not included in the length of a line.\n  * Large gaps go first, then smaller ones ('Lorem--ipsum--dolor--sit-amet,' (2, 2, 2, 1 spaces)).\n  * Last line should not be justified, use only one space between words.\n  * Last line should not contain '\\n'\n  * Strings with one word do not need gaps ('somelongword\\n').\n\nExample with width=30:\n\n```\nLorem  ipsum  dolor  sit amet,\nconsectetur  adipiscing  elit.\nVestibulum    sagittis   dolor\nmauris,  at  elementum  ligula\ntempor  eget.

Its heading is `s1` , it consists of lowercase Latin letters. \n\nFangy the little walrus wants to buy several such newspapers, cut out their headings, glue them one to another in order to get one big string. \n\nAfter that walrus erase several letters from this string in order to get a new word `s2`. \n\nIt is considered that when Fangy erases some letter, there's no whitespace formed instead of the letter. That is, the string remains unbroken and it still only consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nFor example, the heading is `\"abc\"`. If we take two such headings and glue them one to the other one, we get `\"abcabc\"`. If we erase the 1st letter(\"a\") and 5th letter(\"b\"), we get a word `\"bcac\"`.\n\nGiven two string `s1` and `s2`, return the least number of newspaper headings `s1`, which Fangy will need to receive the word `s2`. If it is impossible to get the word `s2` in the above-described manner, return `-1`.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `s1=\"abc\", s2=\"bcac\"`, the output should be `2`.\n\n```\n\"abcabc\" --> \"bcac\"\n x   x\n```\n\nFor `s1=\"abc\", s2=\"xyz\"`, the output should be `-1`.\n\nIt's impossible to get the word `s2`.\n",

While `m` is superior to `0`, at each step:\n* if `m` is not divisible by `2`, add `n` to the list\n* divide `m` by `2` (integer division)\n* multiply `n` by `2`\n\nAt the end, return the list in descending order.\nThe result of the multiplication is the sum of the list elements, but you have to return only the list.\n\n## Input\n`n` and `m` integers, from `0` to `10,000`.

        "description": "There is a common problem given to interviewees in software. It is called FizzBuzz.\nIt works as follows:\nFor the numbers between 1 and 100, print fizz if it is a multiple of 3 and buzz if it is a mutiple of 5, else print the number itself.\n\nYou are in an interview and they ask you to complete fizzbuzz (which can be done in a one-liner in a few langs) and you knock it out of the park.\n\nSurprised by your ability, the interviewer gives you a harder problem. Given a list of coprime numbers, (that is that the g.c.d. of all the numbers == 1) and an equally sized list of words. compute its fizzbuzz representation up until the pattern of strings repeats itself. \n\nHere's an example\n\n```\nfizzbuzz_plusplus([2, 3, 5], ['fizz', 'buzz', 'bazz']); // => [1, 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 'bazz', 'fizzbuzz', 7, 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbazz', 11, 'fizzbuzz', 13, 'fizz', 'buzzbazz', 'fizz', 17, 'fizzbuzz', 19, 'fizzbazz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 23, 'fizzbuzz', 'bazz', 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 29 , 'fizzbuzzbazz']\n```\n\nThings to note: \n * Your function should return an Array of the output for each index, not print it.\n * If elements are 1-indexed, the 10th item is fizz + bazz as 10 == 0 (mod 2) and 10 == 0 (mod 5).\n * The strings are always concatenated from left to right in appearance of array.\n * The number array may not always be sorted - just use the given order of the numbers\n * All numbers in the first array will always be coprime. This is a safe assumption for your program.\n * The list stops where it does because if you were to filter the numbers out, the remaining strings would repeat after this point.\n \nHint: What is the relation to the numbers given in the list and the length of the list?",

The folks at Codwars aren't very good about remembering the contents of their paste buffers.\n\nAll urls contain domains with a single TLD; you need not worry about domains like company.co.uk.\n\n```\nfindCodwars(\"codwars.com\"); // true\nfindCodwars(\"https://subdomain.codwars.com/a/sub/directory?a=querystring\"); // true\nfindCodwars(\"codewars.com\"); // false\nfindCodwars(\"https://subdomain.codwars.codewars.com/a/sub/directory/codwars.com?a=querystring\"); // false\n```",

        "description": "Doesn't everyone love a haiku? \n\nIf you don't know what that is, let me make your day :D\n\nA haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry, they normally have 3 lines with 5, 7 and 5 syllables respectively. For example:\n\n```\ncodewars training day\nregular expressions mean\nmany cups of tea\n```\n\nFeeling a little concerned that I'm about to ask you to write poetry? Fear not! You only have to translate the haiku from numbers to words, no need to start looking frantically for creative inspiration. Let me explain:\n\nI'm giving you:\n1. a function, `haikuWizard()`, which you have to complete.\n2. a big, predefined array with lots of words organised in subarrays! As you can see, each subarray has 10 members and they are all words with the same number of syllables. So `words[0]` contains words of 1 syllable, `words[1]` contains words of 2 syllables and so on.\n```javascript\nvar words = [\n[\"like\", \"a\", \"tweet\", \"what\", \"for\", \"world\", \"whale\", \"one\", \"last\", \"sun\"],\n[\"ocean\", \"beauty\", \"tweet\", \"monster\", \"yellow\", \"return\", \"despair\", \"flower\", \"return\", \"contrast\"],\n[\"romantic\", \"curious\", \"banana\", \"jealousy\", \"tactlessly\", \"remorseful\", \"follower\", \"elephant\", \"however\", \"instagram\"],\n[\"salmonella\", \"consequently\", \"irregular\", \"intelligence\", \"vegetable\", \"ordinary\", \"alternative\", \"watermelon\", \"controversial\", \"marijuana\"],\n[\"lackadaisical\", \"serendipity\", \"colonoscopy\", \"dramatically\", \"parsimonius\", \"imagination\", \"electricity\", \"diabolical\", \"deforestation\", \"abomination\"],\n[\"extraterrestrial\", \"onomatopoeia\", \"responsibility\", \"revolutionary\", \"generalisation\", \"enthusiastically\", \"biodiversity\", \"veterinarian\", \"characteristically\", \"indefatigable\"],\n[\"oversimplification\", \"individuality\", \"decriminalisation\", \"compartmentalisation\", \"anaesthesiologist\", \"industrialisation\", \"buckminsterfullerene\", \"irresponsibility\", \"autobiographical\", \"utilitarianism\"]]\n```\n\nBack to our function: `haikuWizard()` takes an array as its input. This array has 3 subarrays - each subarray represents a line of the haiku. For example:\n\n`[[52], [17, 23, 39, 18], [33, 22]]`\n\nFor each number, the first digit tells you the number of syllables of the word, the second digit tells you which member of the relevant subarray it is.\n\nFor example:\n\n`52`: This means that the first line is made up of one word with 5 syllables, at index 2 in `words[4]`.\n\n`[17, 23, 39, 18]`: This means that the second line is made up of 4 words. The first has 1 syllable and is at index 7 in `words[0]`. The second has 2 syllables and is at index3 in `words[1]`. \nAnd so on... \n\nAll you have to do is complete the function `haikuWizard()` so that it translates the given array back into the beautiful haiku it came from :) \n\nYou should return a string, which on using console.log should display in the appropriate haiku format:\n\n```\nconsole.log(str);\n\nthere's a trumpet man\nwaltzing around the canals\nhe's getting dizzy\n```\n \nThe string itself will not have this format. \n\nTo summarise in case you don't feel like reading all that again:\n- ```haikuWizard()``` should turn ```arr``` into a haiku using the array ```words```.\n- ```arr``` has 3 subarrays, each represents a line of the haiku.\n- the first digit of each number in ```arr``` represents the       number of syllables of the word, the second digit is its index in the   relevant subarray of ```words```.\n- the return string should display a beautiful haiku with the correct     structure.\n\nEnjoy!\n",

To this aim, your function will receive a list of numbers representing a <code>sample</code> of data. Your function must remove any outliers and return the mean of the <code>sample</code>, <strong>rounded</strong> to <strong>two</strong> decimal places (round only at the end).\n\nSince there is no objective definition of \"outlier\" in statistics, your function will also receive a <code>cutoff</code>, in standard deviation units. So for example if the cutoff is 3, then any value that is <strong>more</strong> than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean must be removed. <em>Notice that, once outlying values are removed in a first \"sweep\", other less extreme values may then \"become\" outliers, that you'll have to remove as well!</em>\n\n<strong>Example :</strong>\n```python\nsample = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100]\ncutoff = 3\nclean_mean(sample, cutoff) \u2192 5.5\n```\n```r\n# R uses sam instead of sample to avoid conflicts with the\n# base function sample()\nsam <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100)\ncutoff <- 3\nclean_mean(sam, cutoff)\n[1] 5.5\n```\n\n<strong>Formula for the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean'>mean</a> :</strong>\n\n<img src = 'https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd2f5fb530fc192e4db7a315777f5bbb5d462c90' style=\"background-color:lightgray\"><div></div>\n(where n is the sample size)\n\n<strong>Formula for the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Estimation'>standard deviation</a> :</strong>\n\n<img src = 'https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a937016f00f1978197aa562c5f2d58619f90806' style=\"background-color:lightgray\"><div></div>\n(where N is the sample size, x<sub>i</sub> is observation i and x\u0304 is the sample mean)\n\n<em>Note : since we are not computing the sample standard deviation for inferential purposes, the denominator is n, not n - 1.</em>",

Your superiors want you to devise a way of determining whether a batch of beer is likely to be good enough for sale using a small sample of beers from this batch. Luckily for you, a smart Englishman found a solution to this problem a bit more than a hundred years ago...\n\nYour task in this kata is to implement a function to do Student's one-sample t-test. In the current problem, you will be testing for alcohol content. Your function will receive :  \n<ol>\n<li>A list of the alcohol content of each beer in a sample of beers : <code>sample</code></li>\n<li>A target alcohol content : <code>pop_mean</code></li>\n<li>A probability threshold : <code>alpha</code></li></ol><div></div>\n\nBy calculating a t value for the sample, you will be able to determine whether the current batch is likely to have an average alcohol content close to the target, or not. In statistical terms, if the likelihood that the current sample of beers was taken from the population of beers with a mean of <code>pop_mean</code> (the target alcohol content) is too small (it is too different from the \"average\" sample), then the whole batch will be rejected.\n\n<strong>Specifically,</strong> your solution will calculate a t statistic (formula below) and compare it to a \"critical\" t value, corresponding to the threshold. You are given a table of critical t values (<code>t_table</code>), containing only <strong>positive</strong> values of t (the t distribution is symmetrical) which you may access like so : <code>t_table[degrees_of_freedom - 1][probability]</code>. Degrees of freedom in a one sample t-test are equal to n - 1, where n is the sample size. If the sample's t value is greater than the \"critical\" t value (and therefore less probable), then your function will return \"Reject\". Else, your function will return \"Good to drink\". All samples will range in size from 2 to 20.\n\n<h3>Formula for the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test'>t statistic</a> :</h3>\n<img src = 'https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1063f91f450e9fd0094a38f1856eb11bd201d232'style=\"background-color:white\"><div></div>\nWhere x\u0304 is the sample mean, \u03bc<sub>0</sub> is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n<h3>Formula for the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Estimation'>sample standard deviation (s)</a> :</h3>\n<img src = 'https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bffdcb1ecd0b326bb7ad67397b073af9c15fa6e' style=\"background-color:white\"><div></div>\nWhere N is the sample size, x<sub>i</sub> is observation i and x\u0304 is the sample mean.\n<p>Kata inspired by <a href='https://priceonomics.com/the-guinness-brewer-who-revolutionized-statistics/'>this</a>.</p>",

They have become established as popular small house pets, and, partly because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals. [Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster)\n\n![hamster](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Cashew_sable_syrian_hamster.jpg)\n\nAnd you could have skipped the introduction as it is entirely unrelated to your task. xD\n\n# Task \n\nWrite a function that accepts two inputs: `code` and `message` and returns an encrypted string from `message` using the `code`.   \nThe `code` is a string that generates the key in the way shown below:\n\n```\n 1  | h a m s t e r\n 2  | i b n   u f\n 3  | j c o   v g\n 4  | k d p   w\n 5  | l   q   x\n 6  |         y\n 7  |         z\n\n```\n\nAll letters from `code` get number `1`. All letters which directly follow letters from `code` get number `2` (unless they already have a smaller number assigned), etc. It's difficult to describe but it should be easy to understand from the example below:\n\n```\n 1  | a e h m r s t\n 2  | b f i n     u\n 3  | c g j o     v\n 4  | d   k p     w\n 5  |     l q     x\n 6  |             y\n 7  |             z\n\n```\n\nHow does the encoding work using the `hamster` code?    \n\n```\na => a1\nb => a2\nc => a3\nd => a4\ne => e1\nf => e2\n...\n```\n\nAnd applying it to strings :\n\n```\nhamsterMe('hamster', 'hamster')   => h1a1m1s1t1e1r1\nhamsterMe('hamster', 'helpme')    => h1e1h5m4m1e1\n\n```\n\nAnd you probably started wondering what will happen if there is no `a` in the `code`.  \nJust add these letters after the last available letter (in alphabetic order) in the `code`.\n\nThe key for code `hmster` is:\n```\n 1  | e h m r s t\n 2  | f i n     u\n 3  | g j o     v\n 4  |   k p     w\n 5  |   l q     x\n 6  |           y\n 7  |           z\n 8  |           a\n 9  |           b\n10  |           c\n11  |           d\n```\n\n# Additional notes\n\nThe `code` will have at least 1 letter.   \nDuplication of letters in `code` is possible and should be handled.    \nThe `code` and `message` consist of only lowercase letters.",

        "description": "# Introduction \n\nA grille cipher was a technique for encrypting a plaintext by writing it onto a sheet of paper through a pierced sheet (of paper or cardboard or similar). The earliest known description is due to the polymath Girolamo Cardano in 1550. His proposal was for a rectangular stencil allowing single letters, syllables, or words to be written, then later read, through its various apertures. The written fragments of the plaintext could be further disguised by filling the gaps between the fragments with anodyne words or letters. This variant is also an example of steganography, as are many of the grille ciphers. \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(cryptography)\">Wikipedia Link</a> \n\n![Tangiers1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Tangiers1.png)\n![Tangiers2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Tangiers2.png)\n\n# Task\n\nWrite a function that accepts two inputs: `message` and `code` and returns hidden message decrypted from `message` using the `code`.   \nThe `code` is a nonnegative integer and it decrypts in binary the `message`. \n\n\n```csharp\nGrille(\"abcdef\", 5)  => \"df\"\n\nmessage : abcdef\ncode    : 000101\n----------------\nresult  : df\n\n```\n```javascript\ngrille(\"abcdef\", 5)  => \"df\"\n\nmessage : abcdef\ncode    : 000101\n----------------\nresult  : df\n\n```\n```java\ngrille(\"abcdef\", 5)  => \"df\"\n\nmessage : abcdef\ncode    : 000101\n----------------\nresult  : df\n\n```\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "We're going to create a cipher, so that we can send messages to our friends and no one else will know what cool things we're discussing. Our cipher will take two arguments: a key, in the form of an integer, and a message, in the form of a string.\n\nOur first step is to find the largest prime of the key. For example, the prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3, so the largest prime is 3. We'll also accept negative integers as keys, so -18 would give us a \"largest\" prime of -3. Once we've gotten our prime number, we'll encrypt our message.\n\nThe way we'll encrypt is to use the base ASCII table values of 0-127. We'll take the ASCII value of every character and add the value of our prime number. For example, the character 'D' has an ASCII value of 68, Adding 3 would give 71, which is 'G'.\n\nSo, this will look like the following:\n\nIf we're given a key of 18, and a message of \"Hello, world\", we'll calculate the largest prime to be 3, and then add it to the ASCII values of our string, giving an output of \"Khoor/#zruog\".\n\nWe'll let values greater than 127 or less than 0 \"wrap around\", and start at the other side of the ASCII table, so a -1 will be considered a 127, and a 128 will be considered a 0.",

        "description": "In the nation of CodeWars, there lives an Elder who has lived for a long time. Some people call him the Grandpatriarch, but most people just refer to him as the Elder.\n\nThere is a secret to his longetivity: he has a lot of `young` worshippers, who regularly perform a ritual to ensure that the Elder stays immortal:\n\n- The worshippers line up in a magic rectangle, of dimensions `m` and `n`.\n- They channel their will to wish for the Elder. In this magic rectangle, any worshipper can donate time equal to the `xor` of the column and the row (zero-indexed) he's on, in seconds, to the Elder.\n- However, not every ritual goes perfectly. The donation of time from the worshippers to the Elder will experience a transmission loss `l` (in seconds). Also, if a specific worshipper cannot channel more than `l` seconds, the Elder will not be able to receive this worshipper's donation.\n\nThe estimated age of the Elder is so old it's probably bigger than the total number of atoms in the universe. However, the lazy programmers (who `made a big news` by inventing [the Y2K bug and other related things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_formatting_and_storage_bugs)) apparently didn't think thoroughly enough about this, and so their `simple` date-time system can only record time from 0 to `t-1` seconds. If the elder received the total amount of time (in seconds) more than the system can store, it will be wrapped around so that the time would be between the range 0 to `t-1`.\n\nGiven `m`, `n`, `l` and `t`, please find the number of seconds the Elder has received, represented in the poor programmer's date-time system.\n\n(Note: `t` will never be bigger than `2^32 - 1`, and in JS, `2^26 - 1`.)\n\n---\n\nExample:\n\n```\nm=8, n=5, l=1, t=100\n\nLet's draw out the whole magic rectangle:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n1 0 3 2 5 4 7 6\n2 3 0 1 6 7 4 5\n3 2 1 0 7 6 5 4\n4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3\n\nApplying a transmission loss of 1:\n0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 0 2 1 4 3 6 5\n1 2 0 0 5 6 3 4\n2 1 0 0 6 5 4 3\n3 4 5 6 0 0 1 2\n\nAdding up all the time gives 105 seconds.\n\nBecause the system can only store time between 0 to 99 seconds, the first 100 seconds of time will be lost, giving the answer of 5.\n```\n\n---\n\nThis is no ordinary magic (the Elder's life is at stake), so *you need to care about performance*. All test cases (900 tests) can be passed within 1 second, but `naive` solutions will time out easily. Good luck, and do not displease the Elder.\n",

        "description": "# RoboScript #4 - RS3 Patterns to the Rescue\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe story presented in this Kata Series is purely fictional; any resemblance to actual programming languages, products, organisations or people should be treated as purely coincidental.\n\n## About this Kata Series\n\nThis Kata Series is based on a fictional story about a computer scientist and engineer who owns a firm that sells a toy robot called MyRobot which can interpret its own (esoteric) programming language called RoboScript.  Naturally, this Kata Series deals with the software side of things (I'm afraid Codewars cannot test your ability to build a physical robot!).\n\n## Story\n\nEver since you released [RS2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58738d518ec3b4bf95000192) to the market, there have been much fewer complaints from RoboScript developers about the inefficiency of the language and the popularity of your programming language has continuously soared.  It has even gained so much attention that Zachary Mikowski, the CEO of the world-famous Doodle search engine, has contacted you to try out your product!  Initially, when you explain the RoboScript (RS2) syntax to him, he looks satisfied, but then he soon finds a major loophole in the efficiency of the RS2 language and brings forth the following program:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\n(F2LF2R)2FRF4L(F2LF2R)2(FRFL)4(F2LF2R)2\n</pre> \n\nAs you can see from the program above, the movement sequence `(F2LF2R)2` has to be rewritten every time and no amount of RS2 syntax can simplify it because the movement sequences in between are different each time (`FRF4L` and `(FRFL)4`).  If only RoboScript had a movement sequence reuse feature that makes writing programs like these less repetitive ... \n\n## Task\n\nDefine and implement the RS3 specification whose syntax is a superset of [RS2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58738d518ec3b4bf95000192) (and RS1) syntax.  Your interpreter should be named `execute()` and accept exactly 1 argument `code`, the RoboScript code to be executed.\n\n### Patterns - The New Feature\n\nTo solve the problem outlined in the Story above, you have decided to introduce a new syntax feature to RS3 called the \"pattern\".  The \"pattern\" as defined in RS3 behaves rather like a primitive version of functions/methods in other programming languages - it allows the programmer to define and name (to a certain extent) a certain sequence of movements which can be easily referenced and reused later instead of rewriting the whole thing.\n\nThe basic syntax for defining a pattern is as follows:\n\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\np(n)&lt;CODE_HERE&gt;q\n</pre> \n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n- `p` is a \"keyword\" that declares the beginning of a pattern definition (much like the `function` keyword in JavaScript or the `def` keyword in Python)\n- `(n)` is any non-negative integer (without the round brackets) which acts as a unique identifier for the pattern (much like a function/method name)\n- `<CODE_HERE>` is any valid RoboScript code (without the angled brackets)\n- `q` is a \"keyword\" that marks the end of a pattern definition (like the `end` keyword in Ruby)\n\nFor example, if I want to define `(F2LF2R)2` as a pattern and reuse it later in my code:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\np0(F2LF2R)2q\n</pre> \n\nIt can also be rewritten as below since `(n)` only serves as an identifier and its value doesn't matter:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\np312(F2LF2R)2q\n</pre>\n\nLike function/method definitions in other languages, merely defining a pattern (or patterns) in RS3 should cause no side effects, so:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"p0(F2LF2R)2q\");   # => '*'\nexecute(\"p312(F2LF2R)2q\"); # => '*'\n</pre> \n\nTo invoke a pattern (i.e. make the MyRobot move according to the movement sequences defined inside the pattern), a capital `P` followed by the pattern identifier `(n)` is used:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nP0\n</pre> \n\n(or `P312`, depending on which example you are using)\n\nSo:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"p0(F2LF2R)2qP0\");     # => \"    *\\r\\n    *\\r\\n  ***\\r\\n  *  \\r\\n***  \"\nexecute(\"p312(F2LF2R)2qP312\"); # => \"    *\\r\\n    *\\r\\n  ***\\r\\n  *  \\r\\n***  \"\n</pre> \n\n### Additional Rules for parsing RS3\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the invocation of the pattern or the pattern definition comes first - pattern definitions should **always** be parsed first, so:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"P0p0(F2LF2R)2q\");     # => \"    *\\r\\n    *\\r\\n  ***\\r\\n  *  \\r\\n***  \"\nexecute(\"P312p312(F2LF2R)2q\"); # => \"    *\\r\\n    *\\r\\n  ***\\r\\n  *  \\r\\n***  \"\n</pre> \n\nOf course, RoboScript code can occur anywhere before and/or after a pattern definition/invocation, so:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"F3P0Lp0(F2LF2R)2qF2\"); # => \"       *\\r\\n       *\\r\\n       *\\r\\n       *\\r\\n     ***\\r\\n     *  \\r\\n******  \"\n</pre>\n\nMuch like a function/definition can be invoked multiple times in other languages, a pattern should also be able to be invoked multiple times in RS3.  So:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"(P0)2p0F2LF2RqP0\"); # => \"      *\\r\\n      *\\r\\n    ***\\r\\n    *  \\r\\n  ***  \\r\\n  *    \\r\\n***    \"\n</pre>\n\nIf a pattern is invoked which does not exist, your interpreter should `throw`/`raise` an exception (depending on the language you are attempting this Kata in) of any kind.  This could be anything and will not be tested, but *ideally* it should provide a useful message which describes the error in detail.\n\n```if:php\n**In PHP this must be an inst**\n```\n```if:java\nIn java, throw a `RuntimeException`.\n```\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"p0(F2LF2R)2qP1\");   # throws\nexecute(\"P0p312(F2LF2R)2q\"); # throws\nexecute(\"P312\");             # throws\n</pre>\n\nMuch like any good programming language will allow you to define an unlimited number of functions/methods, your RS3 interpreter should also allow the user to define a virtually unlimited number of patterns.  A pattern definition should be able to invoke other patterns if required.  If the same pattern (i.e. both containing the same identifier `(n)`) is defined more than once, your interpreter should `throw`/`raise` an exception (depending on the language you are attempting this Kata in) of any kind.\n\n```if:php\n**In PHP this error must again be an instance of** `ParseError`.**\n```\n```if:java\nIn java, throw a `RuntimeException`.\n```\n\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"P1P2p1F2Lqp2F2RqP2P1\");                      # => \"  ***\\r\\n  * *\\r\\n*** *\"\nexecute(\"p1F2Lqp2F2Rqp3P1(P2)2P1q(P3)3\");             # => \"  *** *** ***\\r\\n  * * * * * *\\r\\n*** *** *** *\"\nexecute(\"p1F2Lqp1(F3LF4R)5qp2F2Rqp3P1(P2)2P1q(P3)3\"); # throws exception\n</pre>\n\nFurthermore, your interpreter should be able to detect (potentially) infinite recursion, including mutual recursion.  Instead of just getting stuck in an infinite loop and timing out, your interpreter should `throw`/`raise` an exception (depending on the language you are attempting this Kata in) of any kind when the \"stack\" (or just the total number of pattern invocations) exceeds a particular very high (but sensible) threshold, *but only if said pattern with infinite recursion is invoked at least once*.\n\n```if:php\n**In PHP this error must again be an instance of** `ParseError`.**\n```\n```if:java\nIn java, throw a `RuntimeException`.\n```\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nexecute(\"p1F2RP1F2LqP1\");      # throws\nexecute(\"p1F2LP2qp2F2RP1qP1\"); # throws\nexecute(\"p1F2RP1F2Lq\");        # does not throw\n</pre>\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you may assume that all programs passed into your interpreter contains valid syntax.  Furthermore, nesting pattern definitions is not allowed either (it is considered a syntax error) so your interpreter will not need to account for these.\n\n## Kata in this Series\n\n1.

Their instructor guide them explaining an algorithm useful for that task.\n\nAn array of integers, arr, is received.\n\narr = [n1, n2, ....,nk]\n\nThe array should be transformed, doing the following steps:\n\n- each value of the array, ```ni```, will be substituted by the value ```(ni + \u03bc) / \u03bc```\n\n\n```\u03bc = (\u03a3 ni) / k  (mean of the array)```\n\nAfter doing this process recursively, it will be seen that the final array will trend to this final one: ```[2.0, 2.0, .....2.0]```\n\nLet's start with this one: ```[12, 7, 23]```\n```\narray                                               \u03bc                             transformed array                        number of calls\n[12, 7, 23]                                        14.0             [1.8571428571428572, 1.5, 2.642857142857143]                1\n[1.8571428571428572, 1.5, 2.642857142857143]        2.0             [1.9285714285714286, 1.75, 2.321428571428571]               2\n[1.9285714285714286, 1.75, 2.321428571428571]       2.0             [1.9642857142857144, 1.875, 2.1607142857142856]             3\n.............................................       ....             ............................................               ...\n.............................................       ....             ............................................               ...\n[2.0, 2.0, 2.0]                                     2.0             [2.0, 2.0, 2.0]                                            54\n```\nAfter certain number of recursive steps, the difference between ```2``` and the obtained values is so small that cannot be detected by the programming language system.\n\nIn order to estimate the amount of generated values, they need to determine the number of recursive calls for this process.\n\nDo you want to help them?\n\nThey need the function ```simul_close_to2()``` that receives a certain array, and a minimum absolute error, ```abs_error```. The function will output the inner calls.\n\nThe recursion should stop when ```|arr[i] - arr[i + 1]| \u2264 abs_error``` for all ```i``` of the array. For that purpose we need a helper function ```are_contigElemen_closeEnough()``` that receives an array and the abs_error and outputs True when this condition is fulfilled and False when not.\n\nLet's see the above case for different absolute errors:\n```python\nsimul_close_to2([12, 7, 23], pow(10, -5)) == 18 # final array [1.9999989100864957, 1.9999961853027344, 2.00000490461077]\n\nsimul_close_to2([12, 7, 23], pow(10, -8)) == 28 # final array [1.9999999989356314, 1.9999999962747097, 2.000000004789659]\n\nsimul_close_to2([12, 7, 23], pow(10, -12)) == 42 # final array [1.9999999999999352, 1.9999999999997726, 2.000000000000292]\n```\n\nThe tests for the function will have the following features:\n```\nN < 250 (N, number of tests)\n3 \u2264 L \u2264 5000 (L, length of the array)\n1 \u2264 ni \u2264 10000000 (arr = [n1, n2,..., ni, ..., nk])\n10^(-17) \u2264 abs_error \u2264 0.001\n```\nEnjoy it!",

        "description": "As most of you might know already, a prime number is an integer `n` with the following properties:\n\n* it must be greater than 1\n* it must be divisible only by itself and 1\n\nAnd that's it: -15 or 8 are not primes, 5 or 97 are; pretty easy, isn't it?\n\nWell, turns out that primes are not just a mere mathematical curiosity and are very important, for example, to allow a lot of cryptographic algorithms.\n\nBeing able to tell if a number is a prime or not is thus not such a trivial matter and doing it with some efficient algo is thus crucial.\n\nThere are already more or less efficient (or sloppy) katas asking you to find primes, but here I try to be even more zealous than other authors.\n\nYou will be given a preset array/list with the first few `primes`. And you must write a function that checks if a given number `n` is a prime looping through it and, possibly, expanding the array/list of known primes only if/when necessary (ie: as soon as you check for a **potential prime which is greater than a given threshold for each** `n`, stop).\n\n#  Memoization\n\nStoring precomputed results for later re-use is a very popular programming technique that you would better master soon and that is called [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization); while you have your wiki open, you might also wish to get some info about the [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) (one of the few good things I learnt as extra-curricular activity in middle grade) and, to be even more efficient, you might wish to consider [an interesting reading on searching from prime from a friend of mine](https://medium.com/@lcthornhill/why-does-the-6-iteration-method-work-for-testing-prime-numbers-ba6176f58082#.dppj0il3a) [she thought about an explanation all on her own after an evening event in which I discussed primality tests with my guys].\n\nYes, you will be checked even on that part. And you better be **very** efficient in your code if you hope to pass all the tests ;)\n\n**Dedicated to my trainees that worked hard to improve their skills even on a holiday: good work guys!**\n\n**Or should I say \"girls\" ;)?

What the machine object must do is learn from its mistakes! The Machine will be given a command and a number you will return a random action. After the command has returned you will be given a response (true/false) if the response is true then you have done good, if the response is false then the action was a bad one. You must program the machine to learn to apply an action to a given command using the reponse given. Note: It must take no more than 20 times to teach an action to a command also different commands can have the same action.\n\n### Info\n- In the preloaded section there is a constant called ```ACTIONS``` it is a function that returns the 5 possible actions.\n- In Java, this a constant ```Actions.FUNCTIONS``` of type ```List<Function<Integer, Integer>>```. \n- In C++, the actions can be accessed by ```get_action(i)(unsigned int num)``` where i chooses the function (and therefore can range from 0 to 4) and num is its argument.\n- In python ```ACTIONS()``` returns a list of lambdas.\n- In Golang ```Actions()``` retruns a function slice ```[]func(int) int```\n",

For this kata, your purpose is to create a function that takes a url, strips the first part (labelling it always `HOME`) and then builds it making each element but the last a `<a>` element linking to the relevant path; last has to be a `<span>` element getting the `active` `class`.\n\nAll elements need to be turned to uppercase and separated by a separator, given as the second parameter of the function; the last element can terminate in some common extension like `.html`, `.htm`, `.php` or `.asp`; if the name of the last element is `index`.something, you treat it as if it wasn't there, sending users automatically to the upper level folder.\n\nA few examples can be more helpful than thousands of words of explanation, so here you have them:\n```javascript\ngenerateBC(\"mysite.com/pictures/holidays.html\", \" : \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> : <a href=\"/pictures/\">PICTURES</a> : <span class=\"active\">HOLIDAYS</span>'\ngenerateBC(\"www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi\", \" / \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> / <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> / <span class=\"active\">GIACOMOSORBI</span>'\ngenerateBC(\"www.microsoft.com/docs/index.htm\", \" * \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> * <span class=\"active\">DOCS</span>'\n```\n```python\ngenerate_bc(\"mysite.com/pictures/holidays.html\", \" : \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> : <a href=\"/pictures/\">PICTURES</a> : <span class=\"active\">HOLIDAYS</span>'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi\", \" / \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> / <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> / <span class=\"active\">GIACOMOSORBI</span>'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.microsoft.com/docs/index.htm\", \" * \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> * <span class=\"active\">DOCS</span>'\n```\n```ruby\ngenerate_bc(\"mysite.com/pictures/holidays.html\", \" : \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> : <a href=\"/pictures/\">PICTURES</a> : <span class=\"active\">HOLIDAYS</span>'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi\", \" / \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> / <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> / <span class=\"active\">GIACOMOSORBI</span>'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.microsoft.com/docs/index.htm\", \" * \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> * <span class=\"active\">DOCS</span>'\n```\n```java\nSolution.generate_bc(\"mysite.com/pictures/holidays.html\", \" : \").equals( '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> : <a href=\"/pictures/\">PICTURES</a> : <span class=\"active\">HOLIDAYS</span>' );\nSolution.generate_bc(\"www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi\", \" / \").equals( '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> / <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> / <span class=\"active\">GIACOMOSORBI</span>' );\nSolution.generate_bc(\"www.microsoft.com/docs/index.htm\", \" * \").equals( '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> * <span class=\"active\">DOCS</span>' );\n```\n```csharp\nKata.GenerateBC(\"mysite.com/pictures/holidays.html\", \" : \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> : <a href=\"/pictures/\">PICTURES</a> : <span class=\"active\">HOLIDAYS</span>';\nKata.GenerateBC(\"www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi\", \" / \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> / <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> / <span class=\"active\">GIACOMOSORBI</span>';\nKata.GenerateBC(\"www.microsoft.com/docs/index.htm\", \" * \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> * <span class=\"active\">DOCS</span>';\n```\nSeems easy enough?\n\nWell, probably not so much, but we have one last extra rule: if one element (other than the root/home) is longer than 30 characters, you have to shorten it, acronymizing it (i.e.: taking just the initials of every word); url will be always given in the format `this-is-an-element-of-the-url` and you should ignore words in this array while acronymizing: `[\"the\",\"of\",\"in\",\"from\",\"by\",\"with\",\"and\", \"or\", \"for\", \"to\", \"at\", \"a\"]`; a url composed of more words separated by `-` and equal or less than 30 characters long needs to be just uppercased with hyphens replaced by spaces.\n\nIgnore anchors (`www.url.com#lameAnchorExample`) and parameters (`www.url.com?codewars=rocks&pippi=rocksToo`) when present.\n\nExamples:\n```javascript\ngenerateBC(\"mysite.com/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/example.htm\", \" > \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> > <a href=\"/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/\">VLUMSYME</a> > <span class=\"active\">EXAMPLE</span>'\ngenerateBC(\"www.very-long-site_name-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example.com/users/giacomo-sorbi\", \" + \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> + <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> + <span class=\"active\">GIACOMO SORBI</span>'\n```\n```python\ngenerate_bc(\"mysite.com/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/example.htm\", \" > \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> > <a href=\"/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/\">VLUMSYME</a> > <span class=\"active\">EXAMPLE</span>'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.very-long-site_name-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example.com/users/giacomo-sorbi\", \" + \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> + <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> + <span class=\"active\">GIACOMO SORBI</span>'\n```\n```ruby\ngenerate_bc(\"mysite.com/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/example.htm\", \" > \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> > <a href=\"/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/\">VLUMSYME</a> > <span class=\"active\">EXAMPLE</span>'\ngenerate_bc(\"www.very-long-site_name-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example.com/users/giacomo-sorbi\", \" + \") == '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> + <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> + <span class=\"active\">GIACOMO SORBI</span>'\n```\n```java\nSolution.generate_bc(\"mysite.com/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/example.htm\", \" > \").equals( '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> > <a href=\"/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/\">VLUMSYME</a> > <span class=\"active\">EXAMPLE</span>' );\nSolution.generate_bc(\"www.very-long-site_name-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example.com/users/giacomo-sorbi\", \" + \").equals( '<a href=\"/\">HOME</a> + <a href=\"/users/\">USERS</a> + <span class=\"active\">GIACOMO SORBI</span>' );\n```\n\nYou will always be provided **valid url** to webpages **in common formats**, so you probably shouldn't bother validating them.\n\nIf you like to test yourself with actual work/interview related kata, please also consider this one about building [a string filter for Angular.js](http://www.codewars.com/kata/number-shortening-filter).\n\n_Special thanks to [the colleague](http://www.codewars.com/users/jury89) that, seeing my code and commenting that I worked on that as if it was I was on CodeWars, made me realize that it could be indeed a good idea for a kata_ :)",

        "description": "One of the services provided by an operating system is memory management. The OS typically provides an API for allocating and releasing memory in a process's address space. A process should only read and write memory at addresses which have been allocated by the operating system. In this kata you will implement a simulation of a simple memory manager.\n\nThe language you will be using has no low level memory API, so for our simulation we will simply use an array as the process address space. The memory manager constructor will accept an array (further referred to as `memory`) where blocks of indices will be allocated later.\n\n___\n\n# Memory Manager Contract\n\n## allocate(size)\n\n`allocate` reserves a sequential block (sub-array) of `size` received as an argument in `memory`. It should return the index of the first element in the allocated block, or throw an exception if there is no block big enough to satisfy the requirements.\n\n## release(pointer)\n\n`release` accepts an integer representing the start of the block allocated ealier, and frees that block. If the released block is adjacent to a free block, they should be merged into a larger free block. Releasing an unallocated block should cause an exception.\n\n## write(pointer, value)\n\nTo support testing this simulation our memory manager needs to support read/write functionality. Only elements within allocated blocks may be written to. The `write` method accepts an index in `memory` and a `value`. The `value` should be stored in `memory` at that index if it lies within an allocated block, or throw an exception otherwise.\n\n## read(pointer)\n\nThis method is the counterpart to `write`. Only indices within allocated blocks may be read. The `read` method accepts an index. If the `index` is within an allocated block, the value stored in `memory` at that index should be returned, or an exception should be thrown otherwise.",

Your function should be able to accept any word 25 letters or less in length (possibly with some letters repeated), and take no more than 500 milliseconds to run. To compare, when the solution code runs the 27 test cases in JS, it takes 101ms.\n\nFor very large words, you'll run into number precision issues in JS (if the word's position is greater than 2^53). For the JS tests with large positions, there's some leeway (.000000001%). If you feel like you're getting it right for the smaller ranks, and only failing by rounding on the larger, submit a couple more times and see if it takes.\n\nPython, Java and Haskell have arbitrary integer precision, so you must be precise in those languages (unless someone corrects me).\n\nC# is using a `long`, which may not have the best precision, but the tests are locked so we can't change it.\n\nSample words, with their rank:<br />\nABAB = 2<br />\nAAAB = 1<br />\nBAAA = 4<br />\nQUESTION = 24572<br />\nBOOKKEEPER = 10743\n",

Let's see some examples:\n~~~if:python,ruby,javascript\n```python\n[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] returns [[4, -1, 2, 1], 6]\n```\n\nIf in the solution we have two or more arrays having the maximum sum value, the result will have an array of arrays in the corresponding order of the array, from left to right.\n\n```python\n[4, -1, 2, 1, -40, 1, 2, -1, 4]) returns [[[4, -1, 2, 1], [1, 2, -1, 4]], 6]  # From left to right [4, -1, 2, 1] appears in the array before than [1, 2, -1, 4].\n```\n\nIf the array does not have any sub-array with a positive sum of its terms, the function will return ```[[], 0]```.\n~~~\n\n~~~if-not:python,ruby,javascript\n```\n[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] returns ([[4, -1, 2, 1]], 6)\n\n\n[4, -1, 2, 1, -40, 1, 2, -1, 4]) returns ([[4, -1, 2, 1], [1, 2, -1, 4]], 6)  \n\n(From left to right [4, -1, 2, 1] appears in the array before than [1, 2, -1, 4])\n\nIf the array does not have any sub-array with a positive sum of its terms, the function will return ```([], 0)```.\n```\n~~~\nSee more cases in the Example Test Cases Window.\nEnjoy it!\n\nThanks to smile67 (Matthias Metzger from Germany for his important observations in the javascript version)\n",

It seems like they're speaking in another language! Help Tom fit in by translating his well-formatted English into n00b language.\n\nThe following rules should be observed:\n\n- \"to\" and \"too\" should be replaced by the number 2, even if they are only part of a word (E.g. today = 2day)\n- Likewise, \"for\" and \"fore\" should be replaced by the number 4\n- Any remaining double o's should be replaced with zeros (E.g. noob = n00b)\n- \"be\", \"are\", \"you\", \"please\", \"people\", \"really\", \"have\", and \"know\" should be changed to \"b\", \"r\", \"u\", \"plz\", \"ppl\", \"rly\", \"haz\", and \"no\" respectively (even if they are only part of the word)\n- When replacing words, always maintain case of the first letter unless another rule forces the word to all caps.\n- The letter \"s\" should always be replaced by a \"z\", maintaining case\n- \"LOL\" must be added to the beginning of any input string starting with a \"w\" or \"W\"\n- \"OMG\" must be added to the beginning (after LOL, if applicable,) of a string 32 characters<sup>1</sup> or longer\n- All evenly numbered words<sup>2</sup> must be in ALL CAPS (<b>Example:</b> ```Cake is very delicious.``` becomes ```Cake IZ very DELICIOUZ```)\n- If the input string starts with \"h\" or \"H\", the entire output string should be in ALL CAPS\n- Periods ( . ), commas ( , ), and apostrophes ( ' ) are to be removed\n- <sup>3</sup>A question mark ( ? ) should have more question marks added to it, equal to the number of words<sup>2</sup> in the sentence (<b>Example:</b> ```Are you a foo?``` has 4 words, so it would be converted to ```r U a F00????```)\n- <sup>3</sup>Similarly, exclamation points ( ! ) should be replaced by a series of alternating exclamation points and the number 1, equal to the number of words<sup>2</sup> in the sentence (<b>Example:</b> ```You are a foo!``` becomes ```u R a F00!1!1```)\n\n<sup>1</sup> Characters should be counted <b>After:</b> any word conversions, adding additional words, and removing punctuation. <b>Excluding:</b> All punctuation and any 1's added after exclamation marks ( ! ). Character count <b>includes</b> spaces.\n\n<sup>2</sup> For the sake of this kata, \"words\" are simply a space-delimited substring, regardless of its characters. Since the output may have a different number of words than the input, words should be counted based on the output string.\n\n<b>Example:</b> ```whoa, you are my 123 <3``` becomes ```LOL WHOA u R my 123 <3``` = 7 words\n\n<sup>3</sup>The incoming string will be punctuated properly, so punctuation does not need to be validated.\n",

The forward transformation works as follows: Let's say we have a sequence with length n, first write every shift of that string into a *n x n* matrix:\n```\nInput: \"bananabar\"\n\nb a n a n a b a r\nr b a n a n a b a\na r b a n a n a b\nb a r b a n a n a\na b a r b a n a n\nn a b a r b a n a\na n a b a r b a n\nn a n a b a r b a\na n a n a b a r b\n```\nThen we sort that matrix by its rows. The output of the transformation then is the **last column** and the **row index** in which the original string is in:\n```\n               .-.\na b a r b a n a n\na n a b a r b a n\na n a n a b a r b\na r b a n a n a b\nb a n a n a b a r <- 4\nb a r b a n a n a\nn a b a r b a n a\nn a n a b a r b a\nr b a n a n a b a\n               '-'\n\nOutput: (\"nnbbraaaa\", 4)\n```\n\n```if:java\nTo handle the two kinds of output data, we will use the preloaded class `BWT`, whose contract is the following:\n\n    public class BWT {\n        \n        public String s;\n        public int n;\n        \n        public BWT(String s, int n)\n        \n        @Override public String  toString()\n        @Override public boolean equals(Object o)\n        @Override public int     hashCode()\n    }\n\n```\n\nOf course we want to restore the original input, therefore you get the following hints:\n\n1. The output contains the last matrix column.\n2. The first column can be acquired by sorting the last column.\n3. **For every row of the table:** Symbols in the first column follow on symbols in the last column, in the same way they do in the input string.\n4. You don't need to reconstruct the whole table to get the input back.\n\nGoal\n----\n\nThe goal of this Kata is to write both, the `encode` and `decode` functions. Together they should work as the identity function on lists. (*Note:* For the empty input, the row number is ignored.)\n\nFurther studies\n--------------\nYou may have noticed that symbols are not always consecutive, but just in proximity, after the transformation. If you're interested in how to deal with that, you should have a look at [this Kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/move-to-front-encoding/).",

This series is meant to test our coding knowledge.*\n\n## Ciphers #2 - The reversed Cipher\nThis is a lame method I use to write things such that my friends don't understand. It's still fairly readable if you think about it.\n\n## How this cipher works\nFirst, you need to reverse the string. Then, the last character in the original string (the first character in the reversed string) needs to be moved to the back. Words will be separated by spaces, and punctuation marks can be counted as part of the word.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nencode(\"Hello World!\"); // => \"lleHo dlroW!\"\n```\n\nThis is because `\"Hello\"` reversed is `\"olleH\"` and `\"o\"` is moved to the back, and so on. The exclamation mark is considered to be part of the word `\"World\"`.\n\nHave fun (en)coding!",

Unfortunately, some gatecrashers can appear at those parties. The gatecrashers do not know any other party member and should not be at our amazing party!\n\nWe will give to you a collection with all party members and a collection with some guests and their invitations. Your mission is to find out those gatecrashers and give us a sorted array of them.\n\nNote that invitations are undirectional relations, so if guest `A` invites `B`, we can consider that `B` also knows `A`. Once the relation `(A, {B})` appears on the invitations collection, the reverse relation `(B, {A})` may or may not appear in the input. You need to take care of that.\n\n## Example\n\n```python\nparty_members = [0,1,2,3,4]\ninvitations = [ (0, [1,2]), (2, [3]) ]\ngatecrashers = [4]\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nWe have `invitations = [ (0, [1,2]), (2, [3]) ]`.  \nGuest `0` has invited guests `1` and `2`; also, guest `2` has invited guest `3`.\nHowever, noone has invited guest `4`, so he is a gatecrasher.",

Some are slightly more sophisticated, but there is still a consistent rule governing the shift.\n\nThis kata is different. Your task here is to create a random substitution cipher.\n\nThere is no input to the function. The output from your code should be an object in which the keys are simply all the letters of the English alphabet, in lower case and in alphabetical order. The value of each key will also be a lower-case letter, which you should select at random. Because it is random, it is also possible that the original letter and the substituted letter will be the same, as you can see in the following example of possible output:\n\n{\"a\":\"c\", \"b\":\"p\", \"c\":\"j\", \"d\":\"a\", \"e\":\"v\", \"f\":\"d\", \"g\":\"g\", \"h\":\"u\", \"i\":\"l\", \"j\":\"t\", \"k\":\"n\", \"l\":\"w\", \"m\":\"m\", \"n\":\"o\", \"o\":\"i\", \"p\":\"s\", \"q\":\"f\", \"r\":\"r\", \"s\":\"x\", \"t\":\"b\", \"u\":\"h\", \"v\":\"y\", \"w\":\"q\", \"x\":\"e\", \"y\":\"k\", \"z\":\"z\"}\n\nThe output from your solution will be tested for a high probability of randomness.

        "description": "# Introduction\n\nThere is a war and nobody knows - the alphabet war!  \nThe letters hide in their nuclear shelters. The nuclear strikes hit the battlefield and killed a lot of them. \n\n# Task\n\nWrite a function that accepts `battlefield` string and returns letters that survived the nuclear strike.  \n- The `battlefield` string consists of only small letters, `#`,`[` and `]`. \n- The nuclear shelter is represented by square brackets `[]`. The letters inside the square brackets represent letters inside the shelter.  \n- The `#` means a place where nuclear strike hit the battlefield. \nIf there is at least one `#` on the battlefield, all letters outside of shelter die. When there is no any `#` on the battlefield, all letters survive (but do not expect such scenario too often ;-P ).\n- The shelters have some durability. When 2 or more `#` hit close to the shelter, the shelter is destroyed and all letters inside evaporate. The 'close to the shelter' means on the ground between the shelter and the next shelter (or beginning/end of battlefield). The below samples make it clear for you.\n\n# Example \n\n```\nabde[fgh]ijk     => \"abdefghijk\"  (all letters survive because there is no # )\nab#de[fgh]ijk    => \"fgh\" (all letters outside die because there is a # )\nab#de[fgh]ij#k   => \"\"  (all letters dies, there are 2 # close to the shellter )\n##abde[fgh]ijk   => \"\"  (all letters dies, there are 2 # close to the shellter )\n##abde[fgh]ijk[mn]op => \"mn\" (letters from the second shelter survive, there is no # close)\n#ab#de[fgh]ijk[mn]op => \"mn\" (letters from the second shelter survive, there is no # close)\n#abde[fgh]i#jk[mn]op => \"mn\" (letters from the second shelter survive, there is only 1 # close)\n[a]#[b]#[c]  => \"ac\"\n[a]#b#[c][d] => \"d\"\n[a][b][c]    => \"abc\"\n##a[a]b[c]#  => \"c\"\n\n```\n\n\n# Alphabet war Collection\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/59377c53e66267c8f6000027\" target=\"_blank\">Alphavet war </a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5938f5b606c3033f4700015a\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet war - airstrike - letters massacre</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/alphabet-wars-reinforces-massacre\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet wars - reinforces massacre</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/59437bd7d8c9438fb5000004\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet wars - nuclear strike</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/59473c0a952ac9b463000064\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet war - Wo lo loooooo priests join the war</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",

Likewise, if it is raining in the afternoon and he has an umbrella at work, he takes an umbrella for the journey home.\n\n----------------------\n\nGiven an array of the weather conditions, **your task** is to work out the **minimum number of umbrellas** he needs to start with in order that he never gets wet. He can start with some umbrellas at home and some at work, but the **output** is a single integer, the minimum total number.\n\n\nThe **input** is an array/list of consecutive half-day weather forecasts. So, e.g. the first value is the 1st day's morning weather and the second value is the 1st day's afternoon weather. The options are:\n\nWithout umbrella:\n* \"clear\",\n* \"sunny\",\n* \"cloudy\",\n* \"overcast\",\n* \"windy\". \n\nWith umbrella:\n* \"rainy\",\n* \"thunderstorms\".\n\n\ne.g. for three days, 6 values:\n\n```\nweather = [\"rainy\", \"cloudy\", \"sunny\", \"sunny\", \"cloudy\", \"thunderstorms\"]\n```\n\n**N.B.** He never takes an umbrella if it is not raining.\n\n\n#### Examples:\n\n* ```\n  minUmbrellas([\"rainy\", \"clear\", \"rainy\", \"cloudy\"])\n  ```\n\n  should return 2\n\n  Because on the first morning, he needs an umbrella to take, and he leaves it at work.\n  So on the second morning, he needs a second umbrella.\n\n* ```\n  minUmbrellas([\"sunny\", \"windy\", \"sunny\", \"clear\"])\n  ```\n  should return 0\n\n  Because it doesn't rain at all\n\n* ```\n  minUmbrellas([\"rainy\", \"rainy\", \"rainy\", \"rainy\", \"thunderstorms\", \"rainy\"])\n  ```\n  should return 1\n\n  Because he only needs 1 umbrella which he takes on every journey.\n~~~if:java\n#### Note for Java users\nThe following enum is preloaded for you:\n```java\npublic enum Weather {\n    CLEAR, SUNNY, CLOUDY, RAINY, OVERCAST, WINDY, THUNDERSTORMS;\n}\n```\n~~~",

Battles will always accept an enemy level to match against your own.\n- With each battle successfully finished, your warrior's experience is updated based on the enemy's level.\n- The experience earned from the battle is relative to what the warrior's current level is compared to the level of the enemy.\n- A warrior's experience starts from <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">100</span>. Each time the warrior's experience increases by another <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">100</span>, the warrior's level rises to the next level.\n- A warrior's experience is <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">cumulative</span>, and does not reset with each rise of level. The only exception is when the warrior reaches level <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">100</span>, with which the experience stops at <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">10000</span>\n- At every <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">10</span> levels, your warrior will reach a new rank tier. (ex. levels <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">1-9</span> falls within `\"Pushover\"` tier, levels <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">80-89</span> fall within `\"Champion\"` tier, etc.)\n- A warrior cannot progress beyond level <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">100</span> and rank `\"Greatest\"`.\n\n\n<b><span style=\"color:#00BFFF\">Battle Progress Rules & Calculations:</span></b>\n\n- If an enemy level does not fall in the range of 1 to 100, the battle cannot happen and should return `\"Invalid level\"`.\n- Completing a battle against an enemy with the same level as your warrior will be worth <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">10</span> experience points.\n- Completing a battle against an enemy who is one level lower than your warrior will be worth <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">5</span> experience points.\n- Completing a battle against an enemy who is two levels lower or more than your warrior will give <span style=\"color:#e4d00a\">0</span> experience points.\n- Completing a battle against an enemy who is one level higher or more than your warrior will accelarate your experience gaining. The greater the difference between levels, the more experinece your warrior will gain. The formula is `20 * diff * diff` where `diff` equals the difference in levels between the enemy and your warrior.\n- However, if your warrior is at least one rank lower than your enemy, and at least 5 levels lower, your warrior cannot fight against an enemy that strong and must instead return `\"You've been defeated\"`.\n- Every successful battle will also return one of three responses: `\"Easy fight\", \"A good fight\", \"An intense fight\"`. Return `\"Easy fight\"` if your warrior is 2 or more levels higher than your enemy's level. Return `\"A good fight\"` if your warrior is either 1 level higher or equal to your enemy's level.

It should end up returning that description as well.\n- If the warrior's level does not meet the minimum level requirement, the warrior doesn not receive the experience points and description and instead returns `\"Not strong enough\"`, without any archiving of the result.\n\n<b><span style=\"color:#00BFFF\"> Code Examples:</span></b>\n```javascript\nvar bruce_lee = new Warrior();\nbruce_lee.level();        // => 1\nbruce_lee.experience();   // => 100\nbruce_lee.rank();         // => \"Pushover\"\nbruce_lee.achievements(); // => []\nbruce_lee.training([\"Defeated Chuck Norris\", 9000, 1]); // => \"Defeated Chuck Norris\"\nbruce_lee.experience();   // => 9100\nbruce_lee.level();        // => 91\nbruce_lee.rank();         // => \"Master\"\nbruce_lee.battle(90);     // => \"A good fight\"\nbruce_lee.experience();   // => 9105\nbruce_lee.achievements(); // => [\"Defeated Chuck Norris\"]\n```\n```ruby\nbruce_lee = Warrior.new\nbruce_lee.level         # => 1\nbruce_lee.experience    # => 100\nbruce_lee.rank          # => \"Pushover\"\nbruce_lee.achievements  # => []\nbruce_lee.training([\"Defeated Chuck Norris\", 9000, 1]) # => \"Defeated Chuck Norris\"\nbruce_lee.experience    # => 9100\nbruce_lee.level         # => 91\nbruce_lee.rank          # => \"Master\"\nbruce_lee.battle(90)    # => \"A good fight\"\nbruce_lee.experience    # => 9105\nbruce_lee.achievements  # => [\"Defeated Chuck Norris\"]\n```\n```python\nbruce_lee = Warrior()\nbruce_lee.level         # => 1\nbruce_lee.experience    # => 100\nbruce_lee.rank          # => \"Pushover\"\nbruce_lee.achievements  # => []\nbruce_lee.training([\"Defeated Chuck Norris\", 9000, 1]) # => \"Defeated Chuck Norris\"\nbruce_lee.experience    # => 9100\nbruce_lee.level         # => 91\nbruce_lee.rank          # => \"Master\"\nbruce_lee.battle(90)    # => \"A good fight\"\nbruce_lee.experience    # => 9105\nbruce_lee.achievements  # => [\"Defeated Chuck Norris\"]\n```\n```java\n// Note: all numeric values are integers.\n\nWarrior bruce_lee = new Warrior();\nbruce_lee.level();        // => 1\nbruce_lee.experience();   // => 100\nbruce_lee.rank();         // => \"Pushover\"\nbruce_lee.achievements(); // => []  (as List<String>)\nbruce_lee.training(\"Defeated Chuck Norris\", 9000, 1); // => \"Defeated Chuck Norris\"\nbruce_lee.experience();   // => 9100\nbruce_lee.level();        // => 91\nbruce_lee.rank();         // => \"Master\"\nbruce_lee.battle(90);     // => \"A good fight\"\nbruce_lee.experience();   // => 9105\nbruce_lee.achievements(); // => [\"Defeated Chuck Norris\"]  (as List<String>)\n```",

        "description": "## Welcome to my (amazing) kata!\n\nYou are given a gigantic number to decode.  Each number is a code that alternates in a pattern between encoded text and a smaller, encoded number.  The pattern's length varies with every test, but the alternation between encoded text and an encoded number will always be there.  Following this rule, each number tested begins with encoded text and ends with an encoded number.\n\n## How the encoding works\n\nNow, we should probably review how the string of numbers is formed - considering you have to unform it. So, first, some text is taken, and encoded.  The system of encoding is taking each letter's position in the alphabet and adding 100 to it.  For example, `m` in the real text would be `113` in the code-number.\n\nAfter the text, there is a binary number.  You should convert this number to a normal, base 10 decimal (all of them can be converted into whole, non-negative numbers).\n\nSeparating encoded text and encoded numbers, there is a `98`.  Because the numbers are in binary, the only digits they use are '0' and '1', and each letter of the alphabet, encoded, is between 101-127, all instances of `98` are to indicate a separation between encoded text and encoded numbers.  There may also be a `98` at the very end of the number.\n\nWhen you return your final answer, the text and numbers should always be separated by a comma (`,`)\n\n## Example\n\n```python\ndecode(103115104105123101118119981001098113113113981000) = \"codewars, 18, mmm, 8\"\n```\nThe part of the code until the first `98` can be decoded to `\"codewars\"`.  `10010` is binary for `18`. `113113113` translates to `\"mmm\"`.  And `1000` is binary for `8`.\n\nHere is a visualisation of the example:\n```javascript\n103 115 104 105 123 101 118 119   98   10010   98   113 113 113   98   1000\n c   o   d   e   w   a   r   s     ,     18     ,    m   m   m     ,     8\n```\n\nGood luck!",

        "description": "Most languages have a `split` function that lets you turn a string like `\u201chello world\u201d` into an array like`[\u201chello\u201d, \u201cworld\u201d]`. But what if we don't want to lose the separator? Something like `[\u201chello\u201d, \u201c world\u201d]`.\n\n#### Task:\n\nYour job is to implement a function, (`split_without_loss` in Ruby/Crystal, and `splitWithoutLoss` in JavaScript/CoffeeScript), that takes two arguments, `str` (`s` in Python), and `split_p`, and returns the string, split by `split_p`, but with the separator intact. There will be one '|' marker in `split_p`. `str` or `s` will never have a '|' in it. All the text before the marker is moved to the first string of the split, while all the text that is after it is moved to the second one. **Empty strings must be removed from the output, and the input should NOT be modified.**\n\nWhen tests such as `(str = \"aaaa\", split_p = \"|aa\")` are entered, do not split the string on overlapping regions. For this example, return `[\"aa\", \"aa\"]`, not `[\"aa\", \"aa\", \"aa\"]`.\n\n#### Examples (see example test cases for more):\n\n```ruby\nsplit_without_loss(\"hello world!\", \" |\") #=> [\"hello \", \"world!\"]\nsplit_without_loss(\"hello world!\", \"o|rl\") #=> [\"hello wo\", \"rld!\"]\nsplit_without_loss(\"hello world!\", \"h|ello world!\") #=> [\"h\", \"ello world!\"]\nsplit_without_loss(\"hello world!

This series is meant to test our coding knowledge.*\n\n## Ciphers #1 - The 01 Cipher\nThis cipher doesn't exist, I just created it by myself. It can't actually be used, as there isn't a way to decode it. It's a hash. Multiple sentences may also have the same result.\n\n## How this cipher works\nIt looks at the letter, and sees it's index in the alphabet, the alphabet being `a-z`, if you didn't know. If it is odd, it is replaced with `1`, if it's even, its replaced with `0`. Note that the index should start from 0. Also, if the character isn't a letter, it remains the same.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nencode(\"Hello World!\"); // => \"10110 00111!\"\n```\n\nThis is because `H`'s index is `7`, which is odd, so it is replaced by `1`, and so on.\n\nHave fun (en)coding!",

It is particularly important as it relates to the security of available personal information.\n \n For this reason, Ahmed decided to encrypt phone numbers of contacts in such a way that nobody can decrypt them. At first he tried encryption algorithms very complex, but the decryption process is tedious, especially when he needed to dial a speed dial.\n\n He eventually found the algorithm following: instead of writing the number itself, Ahmed multiplied by 10, then adds the result to the original number.\n \n For example, if the phone number is `123`, after the transformation, it becomes `1353`. Ahmed truncates the result (from the left), so it has as many digits as the original phone number. In this example Ahmed wrote `353` instead of `123` in his smart phone.\n\n Ahmed needs a program to recover the original phone number from number stored on his phone. The program return \"impossible\" if the initial number can not be calculated.\n \n Note: There is no left leading zero in either the input or the output; Input `s` is given by string format, because it may be very huge ;-)\n\n# Example\n\n For `s=\"353\"`, the result should be `\"123\"`\n \n ```\n    1230\n  +  123\n  .......\n  = 1353  \n  \n  truncates the result to 3 digit -->\"353\"\n  \n  So the initial number is \"123\"\n ```\n For `s=\"123456\"`, the result should be `\"738496\"`\n \n ```\n    7384960\n  +  738496\n  .........\n  = 8123456\n  \n  truncates the result to 6 digit -->\"123456\"\n  \n  So the initial number is \"738496\"\n ```\n For `s=\"4334\"`, the result should be `\"impossible\"`\n \n Because no such a number can be encrypted to `\"4334\"`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `s`\n\n  string presentation of n with `1 <= n <= 10^100`\n\n\n - `[output]` a string\n\n  The original phone number before encryption, or `\"impossible\"` if the initial number can not be calculated.",

        "description": "In this country soldiers are poor but they need a certain level of secrecy for their communications so, though they do not know Caesar cypher, they reinvent it in the following way.\n\nThe action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter (plaintext letters are from 'a' to 'z' or from 'A' to 'Z') with a different one a fixed number of places up or down the alphabet. This displacement of a number of places is called the \"shift\" or the \"rotate\" of the message. For example, if the shift is `1` letter `a` becomes `b` and `A` becomes `B`; the shift is cyclic so, with a shift of `1`, `z` becomes `a` and `Z` becomes`A`.\n\nThey use ASCII, without really knowing it, but code only letters a-z and A-Z. Other characters are kept such as.\n\nThey change the \"rotate\" each new message. This \"rotate\" is a prefix for their message once the message is coded. The prefix is built of 2 letters, the second one being shifted from the first one by the \"rotate\", the first one is the first letter, after being downcased,\nof the uncoded message.\n\nFor example if the \"rotate\" is 2, if the first letter of the uncoded message is 'J' the prefix should be 'jl'.\n\nTo lessen risk they cut the coded message and the prefix in five pieces since they have only five runners and each runner has only one piece. \n\nIf possible the message will be evenly split between the five runners; if not possible, parts 1, 2, 3, 4 will be longer and part 5 shorter. The fifth part can have length equal to the other ones or shorter. If there are many options of how to split, choose the option where the fifth part has the longest length, provided that the previous conditions are fulfilled. *If the last part is the empty string don't put this empty string in the resulting array.*\n\nFor example, if the coded message has a length of 17 the five parts will have lengths of 4, 4, 4, 4, 1. The parts 1, 2, 3, 4 are evenly split and the last part of length 1 is shorter. If the length is 16 the parts will be of lengths 4, 4, 4, 4, 0. Parts 1, 2, 3, 4 are evenly split and the fifth runner will stay at home since his part is the empty string and is not kept.\n\nCould you ease them in programming their coding?\n\nExample with shift = 1 :\n\nmessage : \"I should have known that you would have a perfect answer for me!!!\"\n\ncode : => [\"ijJ tipvme ibw\", \"f lopxo uibu z\", \"pv xpvme ibwf \", \"b qfsgfdu botx\", \"fs gps nf!!!\"]\n\nBy the way, maybe could you give them a hand to decode?\n\nCaesar cipher : see Wikipedia\n",

        "description": "This Kata is a continuation of [Part 1](http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-fusc-function-part-1). The `fusc` function is defined recursively as follows:\n\n    fusc(0) = 0\n    fusc(1) = 1\n    fusc(2n) = fusc(n)\n    fusc(2n + 1) = fusc(n) + fusc(n + 1)\n    \nYour job is to produce the code for the `fusc` function. In this kata, your function will be tested with large values of `n` more than 1000 bits ( in LC and PHP: at most 52 bits, in OCaml: at most 64 bits ), so you should be concerned about stack overflow and timeouts.\n\nMethod suggestion:\n\nImagine that instead of `fusc(n)`, you were to implement `fib(n)`, which returns the n'th Fibonacci number.\n\nThe function is recursively defined by:\n\n```\n1.    fib(0) = 1\n2.    fib(1) = 1\n3.    fib(n + 2) = fib(n) + fib(n + 1), if n + 2 > 1\n```\nIf one translates the above definition directly into a recursive function, the result is not very efficient. One can try memoization, but that requires lots of space and is not necessary. So, first step is to try and find a _tail recursive_ definition. In order to do that we try to write both sides of equation 3) on the same form. Currently, the left side of the equation contains a single term, whereas the right side is the sum of two terms. A first attempt is to add `fib(n + 1)` to both sides of the equation:\n```\n3.    fib(n + 1) + fib(n + 2) = fib(n) + 2 * fib(n + 1)\n```\nThe two sides of the equation look much more alike, but there is still an essential difference, which is the coefficient of the second term of each side. On the left side of the equation, it is `1`  and, on the right, it is `2`. To remedy this, we can introduce a variable `b`:\n```\n3.    fib(n + 1) + b * fib(n + 2) = b * fib(n) + (b + 1) * fib(n + 1)\n```\nWe notice that the coefficients of the first term are not the same (`1` on the left and `b` on the right), so we introduce a variable `a`:\n```\n3.    a * fib(n + 1) + b * fib(n + 2) = b * fib(n) + (a + b) * fib(n + 1)\n```\nNow the two sides have the same form (call it `F`), which we can define as: \n\n```F(a, b, n) = a * fib(n) + b * fib(n + 1)```\n\nIn fact, we can write equation 3) as:\n```\n3.    F(a, b, n + 1) = F(b, a + b, n)\n```\nWe also have, by definition of `F` and `fib`:\n```\n4.    F(a, b, 0) = a * fib(0) + b * fib(1) = a + b\n```\nAlso, by definition of `F`: \n```\n5.    fib(n) = F(1, 0, n)\n```\n\nThe next step is to translate the above into code:\n```\ndef fib(n):\n\n    def F(a, b, n):\n        if n == 0: return a + b    # see 4. above\n        return F(b, a + b, n - 1)  # see 3. above\n\n    return F(1, 0, n)              # see 5. above\n```\n\nThe final step (optional for languages that support tail call optimization) is to replace the tail recursive function `F` with a loop:\n```\ndef fib(n):\n    a, b = 1, 0                    # see 5. above\n    while n > 0:\n        a, b, n = b, a + b, n - 1  # see 3. above\n    return a + b .                 # see 4. above\n```\nVoila! Now, go do the same with `fusc`.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott`  \n~~~",

Make sure you solve the [first part](/kata/decode-the-morse-code) and the [second part](/kata/decode-the-morse-code-advanced) and then reuse and advance your code to solve this one.</div></div><br>In this kata you have to deal with \"real-life\" scenarios, when Morse code transmission speed slightly varies throughout the message as it is sent by a non-perfect human operator. Also the sampling frequency may not be a multiple of the length of a typical \"dot\".\n\nFor example, the message <code>HEY JUDE</code>, that is <code>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212\u00b7\u2212\u2212 &nbsp; \u00b7\u2212\u2212\u2212 \u00b7\u00b7\u2212 \u2212\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7</code> may actually be received as follows:\n\n<code>0000000011011010011100000110000001111110100111110011111100000000000111011111111011111011111000000101100011111100000111110011101100000100000</code>\n\nAs you may see, this transmission is generally accurate according to the standard, but some dots and dashes and pauses are a bit shorter or a bit longer than the others.\n\nNote also, that, in contrast to the previous kata, the estimated average rate (bits per dot) may not be a whole number &ndash; as the hypotetical transmitter is a human and doesn't know anything about the receiving side sampling rate.\n\nFor example, you may sample line 10 times per second (100ms per sample), while the operator transmits so that his dots and short pauses are 110-170ms long. Clearly 10 samples per second is enough resolution for this speed (meaning, each dot and pause is reflected in the output, nothing is missed), and dots would be reflected as 1 or 11, but if you try to estimate rate (bits per dot), it would not be 1 or 2, it would be about (110 + 170) / 2 / 100 = 1.4. Your algorithm should deal with situations like this well.\n\nAlso, remember that each separate message is supposed to be possibly sent by a different operator, so its rate and other characteristics would be different. So you have to analyze each message (i. e. test) independently, without relying on previous messages. On the other hand, we assume the transmission charactestics remain consistent throghout the message, so you have to analyze the message as a whole to make decoding right. Consistency means that if in the beginning of a message '11111' is a dot and '111111' is a dash, then the same is true everywhere in that message. Moreover, it also means '00000' is definitely a short (in-character) pause, and '000000' is a long (between-characters) pause.\n\nThat said, your task is to implement two functions:\n\n1.&nbsp;Function <code>decodeBitsAdvanced(bits)</code>, that should find an estimate for the transmission rate of the message, take care about slight speed variations that may occur in the message, correctly decode the message to dots <code>.</code>, dashes <code>-</code> and spaces (one between characters, three between words) and return those as a string. Note that some extra <code>0</code>'s may naturally occur at the beginning and the end of a message, make sure to ignore them. If message is empty or only contains <code>0</code>'s, return empty string. Also if you have trouble discerning if the particular sequence of <code>1</code>'s is a dot or a dash, assume it's a dot. If stuck, check <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering\">this</a> for ideas.\n\n2.&nbsp;Function <code>decodeMorse(morseCode)</code>, that would take the output of the previous function and return a human-readable string. If the input is empty string or only contains spaces, return empty string.\n\n**NOTE:** For coding purposes you have to use ASCII characters `.` and `-`, not Unicode characters.\n\nThe Morse code table is preloaded for you as <code>MORSE_CODE</code> dictionary, feel free to use it. For C, the function `morse_code` acts like the dictionary. For C++, Scala and Go, a map is used. For C#, it's called <code>Preloaded.MORSE_CODE</code>. For Racket, a hash called MORSE-CODE is used.\n```racket\n(hash-ref MORSE-CODE \"\".-.\") ; returns \"C\"\n```\n```c\nconst char *morse_code (const char *dotsdashes);\n```\n```cpp\nextern map <string, string> morse_code;\n```\n```scala\nval MorseCodes.MORSE_CODE: Map[string, string];\n```\n```go\nvar MORSE_CODE map[string]string\n```\n\nOf course, not all messages may be fully automatically decoded. But you may be sure that all the test strings would be valid to the point that they could be reliably decoded as described above, so you may skip checking for errors and exceptions, just do your best in figuring out what the message is!\n\nGood luck!",

At school, she wants to make an arrangement of her class to play a certain game with her pupils. For that, she needs to create the arrangement with **the minimum amount of groups that have consecutive sizes**.\n\nLet's see. She has \t```14``` students. After trying a bit she could do the needed arrangement:\n\t```[5, 4, 3, 2]```\n- one group of \t```5``` students\n- another group of \t```4``` students\n- then, another one of \t```3``` \n- and finally, the smallest group of \t```2``` students.\n\nAs the game was a success, she was asked to help to the other classes to teach and show the game. That's why she desperately needs some help to make this required arrangements that make her spend a lot of time. \n\nTo make things worse, she found out that there are some classes with some special number of students that is impossible to get that arrangement.\n\nPlease, help this teacher!\n\nYour code will receive the number of students of the class. It should output the arrangement as an array with the consecutive sizes of the groups in decreasing order.\n\nFor the special case that no arrangement of the required feature is possible the code should output \t```[-1]\t```\n\nThe value of n is unknown and may be pretty high because some classes joined to to have fun with the game.\n\nYou may see more example tests in the Example Tests Cases Box.\n",

The number above it will fill it's place. The rules to fill are: Select one of the two numbers above it, which bear the \"weight\" of relatively large. In other words, there are more numbers on this number. Is this a bit hard to understand? Please see the following:\n \n```\n In the example above, before the execution of drip(), funnel is:\n  \\         /\n   \\7 8 9  /\n    \\4 5 6/\n     \\2 3/\n      \\1/\n ```\n * After drip(), 1 will be dripped out. \n * We should choose a number between 2 and 3 to fill the place of 1.\n * 2 has 5 numbers on it(4,5,7,8,9). 3 has 4 numbers on it(5,6,8,9)\n * So we choose 2 to fill the place of 1\n * And now, the place of 2 is empty. \n * We also need choose a number between 4 and 5 to fill the place of 2.\n * 4 has 2 numbers on it(7,8). 5 has 2 numbers on it too(8,9)\n * There are same \"weight\" on 4 and 5, \n * In this case, we choose the number on the left\n * So we choose 4 to fill the place of 2\n * And then choose 7 to fill the place of 4\n \nLet us continue to `drip()`:\n \n

        "description": "The Binomial Form of a polynomial has many uses, just as the standard form does.  For comparison, if p(x) is in Binomial Form and q(x) is in standard form, we might write\n\np(x) := a<sub>0</sub> \\* xC0 + a<sub>1</sub> \\* xC1 + a<sub>2</sub> \\* xC2 + ... + a<sub>N</sub> \\* xCN\n\nq(x) := b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub> \\* x + b<sub>2</sub> \\* x<sup>2</sup> + ... + b<sub>N</sub> \\* x<sup>N</sup>\n\nBoth forms have tricks for evaluating them, but tricks should not be necessary.  The most important thing to keep in mind is that aCb can be defined for non-integer values of a; in particular,\n\n```\naCb := a * (a-1) * (a-2) * ... * (a-b+1) / b!   // for any value a and integer values b\n    := a! / ((a-b)!b!)                          // for integer values a,b\n```\n\nThe inputs to your function are an array which specifies a polynomial in Binomial Form, ordered by highest-degree-first, and also a number to evaluate the polynomial at.  An example call might be\n\n```javascript\nvalueAt([1, 2, 7], 3);\n```\n```python\nvalue_at([1, 2, 7], 3)\n```\n```ruby\nvalue_at([1, 2, 7], 3)\n```\n\nand the return value would be 16, since 3C2 + 2 * 3C1 + 7 = 16.  In more detail, this calculation looks like\n\n```\n1 * xC2 + 2 * xC1 + 7 * xC0 :: x = 3\n3C2 + 2 * 3C1 + 7\n3 * (3-1) / 2! + 2 * 3 / 1! + 7\n3 + 6 + 7 = 16\n```\n\nMore information can be found by reading about [Binomial Coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) or about [Finite Differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).\n\nNote that while a solution should be able to handle non-integer inputs and get a correct result, any solution should make use of rounding to two significant digits (as the official solution does) since high precision for non-integers is not the point here.",

        "description": "# Church Numbers\nChurch Numbers are representations of natural numbers (non-negative integers) as functions. Not only as functions, but as functions that can perform a task upon a value a set number of times. This is an important concept of Lambda Calculus, so naturally we'll have to talk about Lambda Calculus.\n\n# Lambda Calculus\nLambda Calculus is a syntax for functional computing/mathematics. In Lambda Calculus, a function has one input, and one output. However, the input function can be another lambda function (which accepts another input), and this can somewhat simulate multiple inputs with some important differences; this is called \"currying\".\n\nSome languages (e.g., Haskell) naturally use curried functions. Other languages (e.g., Javascript) must have currying forced upon them. The solution starts with the functions properly curried, and will need to remain that way.\n\n# Church Functions\nBack to Church Numbers. With a Church Number, we want to accept \"two inputs\" (a function ```f``` and a value ```x```; remember they're curried, so it's ```c(f)(x)``` not ```c(f, x)```), and we want to successively perform ```f``` on ```x```. So, if we have Church Number 2, that should mean ```f(f(x))```. If you're working in Haskell, ignore this bit; you're already curried.\n\nTo define this, we'll start at zero:\n\n```javascript\nvar zero = (f) => (x) => x;\n```\n```python\nzero = lambda f: lambda x: x\n```\n```haskell\ntype Lambda a = (a -> a)\ntype Cnum a = Lambda a -> Lambda a\n\nzero :: Cnum a\nzero f = id\n```\n\nAs you can see, zero accepts a function, and returns a function. The returned function performs ```f``` zero times and returns the result (also known as an identify function). One goes a step further:\n\n```javascript\nvar one = (f) => (x) => f(x);\n```\n```python\none = lambda f: lambda x: f(x)\n```\n```haskell\none :: Cnum a\none f = f\n```\n\nOf course, it would get tedious to have to declare every natural number you need. So let's write a successor function:\n\n```javascript\nvar succ = (c) => (f) => (x) => f(c(f)(x));\n```\n```python\nsucc = lambda c: lambda f: lambda x: f(c(f)(x))\n```\n```haskell\nchurchSucc :: Cnum a -> Cnum a\nchurchSucc c = (\\h -> h . c h)\n```\n\nThe successor function takes a Church Number (including zero), and returns a function that performs one more application of ```f``` than the previous Church Number. So, ```succ(zero)``` is equivalent to ```one```, ```succ(succ(zero))``` is ```two```, etc.. And how you use a Church Number ```c``` is to:\n\n```javascript\nvar result = c(f)(x);\n```\n```python\nresult = c(f)(x)\n```\n```haskell\nlet result = c f x\n```\n\n```result``` will be ```f``` performed on ```x``` ```c``` times. So if ```c``` is 3 (```succ(succ(succ(zero)))```), result will be ```f(f(f(x)))```.\n\n# Your Goal\nImplement some basic arithmetic for Church Numbers, namely adding, multiplying, and exponentiation. Performance is part of this kata; if you're timing out (and Codewars isn't under load), you'll need to come up with more efficient functions.\n\n## General Tips\nSince the functions are curried, you can call a function with only one \"input\" and receive a function back. Think of this like the classic ```adder``` function:\n\n```javascript\nvar addX = (x) => (y) => x + y;\nvar addOne = addX(1);\naddOne(5);// == 6\n```\n```python\nadd_x = lambda x: lambda y: x + y\nadd_one = add_x(1)\nadd_one(5) # == 6\n```\n```haskell\naddX x y = x + y\naddOne y = addX 1\nlet six = addOne 5\n```\n\nWith Church Numbers, this means that ```c(f)``` is a function that takes one input (x) and returns ```f``` performed on ```x``` ```c``` times. The ability to pass this function around is useful, to give an example, for multiplying.\n\n## Adding Tips\nWhat you want to do is perform ```f``` on ```x``` through an entire one of your Church inputs, then feed that value into your next Church input as if it were ```x```.  \nLambda Calculus definition for adding: ```c1 f (c2 f x)```\n\n## Multiplying Tips\nYou can use repeated adding to multiply, but there's a much cleaner solution. Remember ```c(f)``` is a function of its own.  \nLambda Calculus definition for multiplying: ```c1 (c2 f) x```\n\n## Exponentiation Tips\nSimilar to multiplying, you _could_ use repeated multiplication, but it's better not to. In fact, exponentiation is syntactically simpler than adding with Church Numbers (even if it takes some brain gymnastics to figure out why).  \nLambda Calculus definition: ```(ce cb) f x```\n\nWhile it isn't a hard requirement for this kata, try to implement multiplying without adding, and exponentiation without multiplying or adding. It's actually simpler this way (really).\n\n## Testing Tips\n\nThe following functions are preloaded; feel free to use them for testing purposes. They can't be used when you Submit, only when you run your own test cases.\n\n```javascript\nvar zero = (f) => (x) => x;\nvar succ = (c) => (f) => (x) => f(c(f)(x));\nvar numerify = (c) => c((i) => i + 1)(0); //Turns a Church Number into an integer\nvar churchify = (n) => (f) => (x) => { //Turns an integer into a Church Number.\n      for(var i = 0; i < n; i++) x = f(x);\n      return x;\n    };\n//For churchify, why don't we use succ(churchify(n - 1))? The stack size gets out of hand.\n```\n```python\nzero = lambda f: lambda x: x\nsucc = lambda c: lambda f: lambda x: f(c(f)(x))\nnumerify = lambda c: c(lambda i: i + 1)(0)\ndef churchify(n):\n  def _f(f):\n    def _x(x):\n      for i in range(n): x = f(x)\n      return x\n    return _x\n  return _f\n# For churchify, why don't we use succ(churchify(n - 1))? The stack size gets out of hand.\n```\n```haskell\nmodule Haskell.Codewars.Church.Preloaded where\n\ntype Lambda a = (a -> a)\ntype Cnum a = Lambda a -> Lambda a\n\nzero :: Cnum a\nzero f = id\n\nchurchSucc :: Cnum a -> Cnum a\nchurchSucc c = (\\h -> h . c h)\n\nchurchify 0 = zero\nchurchify n = churchSucc (churchify (n-1))\n\nnumerify :: Cnum Int -> Int\nnumerify c = c (+1) 0\n```\n\nYou won't need to sanitize your inputs; you will always receive valid Church Numbers into churchAdd, churchMul, and churchPow.\n\n## Beta Notes\n\nA C# version is forthcoming. If someone else translates into other languages, I'll add them as well. It's improbable that a satisfactory Java solution can be made since generics and lambdas don't play well.\n\nAfter you finish, please mark as Ready (or add why it isn't to the discussion) and give a kyu rating.",

Let The number of first pile equals to `x+y`, the number of second pile equals to `x-y`, the number of third pile equals to `x*y`, the number of fourth pile equals to `x/y`. We need to calculate how many apples are there in each pile.\n\nOf course, there won't be so many unknowns. We know the total number of apples(`n`) and the second mysterious number(`y`). \n\nFor example: there are 48 apples need to divided into four piles. y=3. that is, 1st pile should be x+3, 2nd pile should be x-3, 3rd pile should be x*3, 4th pile should be x/3.\nDo you know how much `x` is? `x` should be 9, because:\n```\n(9 + 3) + (9 - 3) + (9 * 3) + (9 / 3) = 12 + 6 + 27 + 3 = 48\n```\nSo, 48 apples should be divided into `12, 6, 27, 3`.\n\n## Task\n\nImplement a function that accepts two argument, `n` and `y`, and returns the number of apples in each pile as described above. Each resulting number should be a positive integer. If there's no way to divide the apples, return an empty array/empty value (refer to the function declaration and test cases in your language of choice to see which option is relevant for you).\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nn = 48\ny = 3\nresult = [12, 6, 27, 3]\n\nn = 100\ny = 4\nresult = [20, 12, 64, 4]\n\nn = 24\ny = 4\nresult = []  (no way to divide the apples)\n\nn = 25\ny = 4\nresult = []  ([8,0,16,1] is not a correct answer since you can't have empty piles)\n```",

When a girl wants to pass something to the other girls and there are some boys nearby, she can use Ka cypher. So only the other girls are able to understand her. <br/>\nShe speaks using KA, ie.: <br>\n`ka thi ka s ka bo ka y ka i ka s ka u ka gly` what simply means `this boy is ugly`. <br/>\n\n\n# Task \n\nWrite a function that accepts a string word and returns encoded message using ka cypher. <br/><br/>\nOur rules:<br>\n- The encoded word should start from `ka`.\n- The `ka` goes after vowel (a,e,i,o,u)\n- When there is multiple vowels together, the `ka` goes only after the last `vowel`\n- When the word is finished by a vowel, do not add the `ka` after\n\n# Input/Output\n\nThe `word` string consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters. There is only 1 word to convert - no white spaces.\n\n# Example\n\n```\n\"a\" => \"kaa\"\n\"ka\" => \"kaka\"\n\"aa\" => \"kaaa\"  \n\"Abbaa\" => \"kaAkabbaa\"\n\"maintenance\" => \"kamaikantekanakance\"\n\"Woodie\" => \"kaWookadie\"\n\"Incomprehensibilities\" => \"kaIkancokamprekahekansikabikalikatiekas\"\n```\n\n# Remark\n\nKa cypher's country residents, please don't hate me for simplifying the way how we divide the words into \"syllables\" in the Kata.

        "description": "#Rotate a square matrix like a vortex\n\nYour task is to rotate a square matrix of numbers like a vortex. \n```\nIn most vortices, the fluid flow velocity is greatest next to its axis and decreases in inverse proportion to the distance from the axis.\n```\nSo the rotation speed increases with every ring nearer to the middle.\n\nFor this kata this means, that the outer \"ring\" of the matrix rotates one step. The next ring rotates two steps. The next ring rotates three steps. And so on...\n\nThe rotation is always \"to the left\", so against clockwise!<br>\n\nAn example:\n```\nThe given matrix:\n5 3 6 1\n5 8 7 4\n1 2 4 3\n3 1 2 2\n\nFirst step:\nThe outer ring is rotated once to the left.\n5 3 6 1  ->  1 4 3 2\n5 8 7 4  ->  6 8 7 2\n1 2 4 3  ->  3 2 4 1\n3 1 2 2  ->  5 5 1 3\n\nSecond step:\nThe second ring is rotated twice to the left.\n8 7 -> 7 4 -> 4 2\n2 4 -> 8 2 -> 7 8 \n\nIn the whole square the second step looks like this:\n1 4 3 2  ->  1 4 3 2\n6 8 7 2  ->  6 4 2 2\n3 2 4 1  ->  3 7 8 1\n5 5 1 3  ->  5 5 1 3\n\nNo more rings. So the result is clear.\n\n```\n\n#Task\nCreate the method for rotating like a vortex.\nThe method has one input parameter:<br>\nThe sqaure matrix as an array of arrays <br>\n\nYour method have to return the rotated matrix. You must not change the input array! Create a new array for the output.\n\nThe square matrix will always be at least 1x1 and at most 20x20 and of course the array will never be null.\n<br><br><br>\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have also created other katas.

In that case string should be returned untouched.\n- If no `glue` is sent `...` should be used by default\n- If `glue` cannot go exactly in the middle, **second part** should be longer\n- If glue cannot fit in the shortened string, string should be shortened without shrinking.\n  - meaning; `shorten('hello world', 5, '....')` should return `hello` because 4 char glue cannot fit in the shortened string.\n  - glue must have at least 1 char on both ends. Example minimum `h...d`, results `....d` or `h....` are not excepted. \n- You can assume you'll always receive a `string` as the sentence and the glue.

Each level corresponds to adding one point to a stat of the player's choice. Also, there are 10 possible classes each having their own starting level and stats:\n\n```\nWarrior     (Level 4):  11, 8, 12, 13, 13, 11, 9, 9\nKnight      (Level 5):  14, 10, 10, 11, 11, 10, 9, 11\nWanderer    (Level 3):  10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 12, 11, 8\nThief       (Level 5):  9, 11, 9, 9, 15, 10, 12, 11\nBandit      (Level 4):  12, 8, 14, 14, 9, 11, 8, 10\nHunter      (Level 4):  11, 9, 11, 12, 14, 11, 9, 9\nSorcerer    (Level 3):  8, 15, 8, 9, 11, 8, 15, 8\nPyromancer  (Level 1):  10, 12, 11, 12, 9, 12, 10, 8\nCleric      (Level 2):  11, 11, 9, 12, 8, 11, 8, 14\nDeprived    (Level 6):  11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11\n```\n\nFrom level 1, the necessary souls to level up each time up to 11 are `673`, `690`, `707`, `724`, `741`, `758`, `775`, `793`, `811`, and `829`. Then from 11 to 12 and onwards the amount is defined by the expression `round(pow(x, 3) * 0.02 + pow(x, 2) * 3.06 + 105.6 * x - 895)` where `x` is the number corresponding to the next level.\n\nYour function will receive a string with the character class and a list of stats. It should calculate which level is required to get the desired character build and the amount of souls needed to do so. The result should be a string in the format: `'Starting as a [CLASS], level [N] will require [M] souls.'` where `[CLASS]` is your starting class, `[N]` is the required level, and `[M]` is the amount of souls needed respectively.",

The number of candies each child gets is not always the same. Here is an array `candies`(all elements are positive integer). It's the number of candy for each child:\n ```\n candies = [10,2,8,22,16,4,10,6,14,20]\n ```\n The teacher asked the children to form a circle and play a game: Each child gives half of his candies to the child on his right(at the same time). If the number of children's candy is an odd number, the teacher will give him an extra candy, so that he can evenly distribute his candy. \n \n Repeat such distribute process, until all the children's candies are equal in number.\n \n You should return two numbers: 1.How many times of distribution; 2. After the game, the number of each child's candy.

Let's punish those filthy capitalists, as we all know that being rich has to be somehow a fault and a shame!\n\nIf you happen to have few people as the richest, just take from the ones with the lowest index (the closest to the left, in few words) in the array first, on a 1:1 based heroic proletarian redistribution, until everyone is satisfied.\n\nTo clarify this rule, assuming a population `[2,3,5,45,45]` and `5` as `minimum`, the expected result should be `[5,5,5,42,43]`.\n\nIf you want to see it in steps, consider removing `minimum` from every member of the population, then iteratively (or recursively) adding 1 to the poorest while removing 1 from the richest. Pick the element most at left if more elements exist with the same level of minimal poverty, as they are certainly even more aligned with the party will than other poor people; similarly, it is ok to take from the richest one on the left first, so they can learn their lesson and be more kind, possibly giving more *gifts* to the inspectors of the State!\n\nIn steps:\n```\n[ 2, 3, 5,45,45] becomes\n[-3,-2, 0,40,40] that then becomes\n[-2,-2, 0,39,40] that then becomes\n[-1,-2, 0,39,39] that then becomes\n[-1,-1, 0,38,39] that then becomes\n[ 0,-1, 0,38,38] that then becomes\n[ 0, 0, 0,37,38] that then finally becomes (adding the minimum again, as no value is no longer under the poverty threshold\n[ 5, 5, 5,42,43]\n```\n\nIf giving `minimum` is unfeasable with the current resources (as it often comes to be the case in socialist communities...), for example if the above starting population had set a goal of giving anyone at least `30`, just return an empty array `[]`.",

        "description": "# Introduction \n\nDigital Cypher assigns a unique number to each letter of the alphabet:\n\n```\n a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n```\n\nIn the encrypted word we write the corresponding numbers instead of the letters. For example, the word `scout` becomes:\n\n```\n s  c  o  u  t\n19  3 15 21 20\n```\nThen we add to each number a digit from the key (repeated if necessary). For example if the key is `1939`:\n\n```\n   s  c  o  u  t\n  19  3 15 21 20\n + 1  9  3  9  1\n ---------------\n  20 12 18 30 21\n  \n   m  a  s  t  e  r  p  i  e  c  e\n  13  1 19 20  5 18 16  9  5  3  5\n+  1  9  3  9  1  9  3  9  1  9  3\n  --------------------------------\n  14 10 22 29  6 27 19 18  6  12 8\n```\n\n# Task\n\nWrite a function that accepts a `message` string  and an array of integers `code`. As the result, return the `key` that was used to encrypt the `message`. The `key` has to be shortest of all possible keys that can be used to code the `message`: i.e. when the possible keys are `12` , `1212`, `121212`, your solution should return `12`.\n\n#### Input / Output:\n\n* The `message` is a string containing only lowercase letters.<br/>\n* The `code` is an array of positive integers.<br/>\n* The `key` output is a positive integer.\n\n# Examples\n\n```javascript\nfindTheKey(\"scout\", [20, 12, 18, 30, 21]);  =>  1939\nfindTheKey(\"masterpiece\", [14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8]);  =>  1939 \nfindTheKey(\"nomoretears\", [15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20]);  =>  12\n```\n```csharp\nFindTheKey(\"scout\", new int[]{20, 12, 18, 30, 21});  => 1939\nFindTheKey(\"masterpiece\", new int[]{14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8});  =>  1939\nFindTheKey(\"nomoretears\", new int[]{15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20});  =>  12\n```\n```go\nFindTheKey(\"scout\", []int{20, 12, 18, 30, 21})  => 1939\nFindTheKey(\"masterpiece\", []int{14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8})  => 1939\nFindTheKey(\"nomoretears\", []int{15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20})  => 12\n```\n```ruby\nfind_the_key(\"scout\", [20, 12, 18, 30, 21]) # -->  1939\nfind_the_key(\"masterpiece\", [14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8]) # -->  1939\nfind_the_key(\"nomoretears\", [15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20]) # -->  12\n```\n```python\nfind_the_key(\"scout\", [20, 12, 18, 30, 21]) # -->  1939\nfind_the_key(\"masterpiece\", [14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8]) # -->  1939\nfind_the_key(\"nomoretears\", [15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20]) # -->  12\n```\n```nasm\nmsg:    db    `scout\\0`\ncode:   db    20, 12, 18, 30, 21\nmov rdi, msg\nmov rsi, code\nmov rdx, 5\ncall find_the_key    ; EAX <- 1939\n\nmsg:    db    `masterpiece\\0`\ncode:   db    14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8\nmov rdi, msg\nmov rsi, code\nmov rdx, 11\ncall find_the_key    ; EAX <- 1939\n\nmsg:    db    `nomoretears\\0`\ncode:   db    15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20\nmov rdi, msg\nmov rsi, code\nmov rdx, 11\ncall find_the_key    ; EAX <- 12\n```\n```c\nfind_the_key(\"scout\", (const unsigned char[]){20, 12, 18, 30, 21}, 5) /* -->  1939  */\nfind_the_key(\"masterpiece\", (const unsigned char[]){14, 10, 22, 29, 6, 27, 19, 18, 6, 12, 8}, 11) /* -->  1939  */\nfind_the_key(\"nomoretears\", (const unsigned char[]){15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 7, 21, 7, 2, 20, 20}, 11) /* -->  12  */\n```\n\n# Digital cypher series\n- [Digital cypher vol 1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/592e830e043b99888600002d)\n- [Digital cypher vol 2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/592edfda5be407b9640000b2)\n- [Digital cypher vol 3 - missing key](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5930d8a4b8c2d9e11500002a)\n",

It was first published in the 19th century by \u00c9douard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, boxes, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.\n\nStarting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1\u00d71 box earns one point and takes another turn only if another box can be made. (A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial). The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. The board may be of any size. When short on time, a 2\u00d72 board (a square of 9 dots) is good for beginners. A 5\u00d75 is good for experts.

        "description": "From wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)> \n\nIn number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, \nis a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. \nTwo sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the **same** partition.\n\nFor example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:\n\n`4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`.\n\nWe can write:\n\n`enum(4) -> [[4],[3,1],[2,2],[2,1,1],[1,1,1,1]]` and\n\n`enum(5) -> [[5],[4,1],[3,2],[3,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`.\n\nThe number of parts in a partition grows very fast.\nFor n = 50 number of parts is `204226`, for 80 it is `15,796,476`\nIt would be too long to tests answers with arrays of such size. So our task is the following:\n\n1 - n being given (n integer, 1 <= n <= 50) calculate enum(n) ie the partition of n.\nWe will obtain something like that:  \n`enum(n) -> [[n],[n-1,1],[n-2,2],...,[1,1,...,1]]` (order of array and sub-arrays\ndoesn't matter). This part is not tested.\n\n2 - For each sub-array of enum(n) calculate its product. \nIf n = 5 we'll obtain **after removing duplicates and sorting**:\n\n`prod(5) -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]`\n\n`prod(8) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18]`\n\nIf n = 40 prod(n) has a length of `2699` hence the tests will not verify such arrays.\nInstead our task number 3 is:\n\n3 - return the range, the average and the median of prod(n) in the following form \n(example for n = 5):\n\n`\"Range: 5 Average: 3.50 Median: 3.50\"`\n\nRange is an integer, Average and Median are float numbers rounded to two decimal \nplaces (\".2f\" in some languages).\n\n#### Notes:\n`Range` : difference between the highest and lowest values. \n\n`Mean or Average` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers \nin a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.\n\n`Median` : The median is the number separating the higher half \nof a data sample from the lower half. \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)\n\n#### Hints:\nTry to optimize your program to avoid timing out.\n\nMemoization can be helpful but it is not mandatory for being successful.\n",

        "description": "In this Kata, we use the Euler method for integrating a function (see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)).\n\nRemember that integrating a function basically means 'calculating the area under a curve'. One way to approximate the area is to chop it up into rectangles (whose area is just height * width) and sum them (see [this other wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle_method) which has a nice gif illustrating this point). We are going to do just this.\n\nLet  `y = 5 + 2 * x + 3 * x^2`. \n\nWrite a function \n\n```def euler(stop, step_size)```\n\nthat calculates the integral of y between `x = 0` and `x = stop`.  For the sake of simplicity, `stop > 0`.\n\nAs the example test shows, the code will be verified by using a `step_size of 0.0001`, then rounding the output to the nearest integer. ",

You will be given a list of random points contained in a cube of side of length 2l. The center of the cube coincides with the center of the coordinates system xyz, the point (0, 0, 0). You can see the above image to understand that the radius of the spehere is half of the side of the cube. To estimate  Pi we should count the amount of points that are contained in the sphere inscribed in the cube.\n\nThe function ``` mCarlo3D_pi() ```, will receive a list of numeruous points.

However far it seemed, it can't compare to the uncounted days I have been trapped here in this endless void. To break the monotony, it shall do nicely.\n\nReaching the triangle, I inspected it. It is even more spectacular up close than a far, like a piece of the heavens, just as grand as the best Hubble photo I've ever seen. Adorned onto its striking surface were two numbers, each hugging a side of the triangle in white chalk.\n\n```javascript\n{a: 3, b: 4}\n```\n```coffeescript\n{a: 3, b: 4}\n```\n```csharp\nTriangle(3, 4, NaN)\n```\n```python\n{'a': 3, 'b': 4}\n```\n```ruby\n{:a => 3, :b => 4}\n```\n\nAlmost unconsciously, I grabbed at the misshapen chalk piece in my pocket, a small stone shaped calcium oddity I found among the void. I am hit with the sudden urge to write on the cosmic shape, to complete the numbers by filling in the missing side. The shear burning desire scares me, but I did it anyway. With a bit of internal head math, I wrote down my solution.\n\n```javascript\n{a: 3, b: 4, c: 5}\n```\n```coffeescript\n{a: 3, b: 4, c: 5}\n```\n```csharp\nTriangle(3, 4, 5)\n```\n```python\n{'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 5}\n```\n```ruby\n{:a => 3, :b => 4, :c =>5}\n```\n\nThe triangle glowed white, contrasting almost blindingly against the surrounding darkness around me. Could it be, that solving this shape would be my salvation, my escape from this dark and empty place?\n\nI stared at the shining geometry for what felt like ever, before, with a disappointed sigh, I glanced away from the mesmerizing false hope. Only to catch the sight of two more triangles of right angles.\n\n```javascript\n{a: 5, c: 13}\n{b: 2, c: 3}\n```\n```coffeescript\n{a: 5, c: 13}\n{b: 2, c: 3}\n```\n```csharp\nTriangle(5, NaN, 13)\nTriangle(NaN, 2, 3)\n```\n```python\n{'a': 5, 'c': 13}\n{'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n```ruby\n{:a => 5, :c => 13}\n{:b => 2, :c => 3}\n```\n\nSomehow, I knew the third triangle had its first side unmarked, rather than its second, I'll have to take that into account were I to do this right. I idly solved them both, looking on in wonder as they too turned white.\n\n```javascript\n{a: 5, c: 13, b: 12}\n{b: 2, c: 3, a: 2.236}\n```\n```coffeescript\n{a: 5, c: 13, b: 12}\n{b: 2, c: 3, a: 2.236}\n```\n```csharp\nTriangle(5, 12, 13)\nTriangle(2.236, 2, 3)\n```\n```python\n{'a': 5, 'b': 12, 'c': 13}\n{'a': 2.236, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n```\n```ruby\n{:a => 5, :c => 13, :b => 12}\n{:b => 2, :c => 3, :a => 2.236}\n```\n\nSomething on the edge of my peripheral vision moved. I looked up, to be greeted with hundreds of right triangles, like angels from the heavens, coming down right at me.\n\nI might need a better solution to turn them all shining white...",

The key is written as paired letters, which are in the cipher simple replacement.\n\nThe most frequently used key is \"GA-DE-RY-PO-LU-KI\".\n\n```\n g => a\n a => g\n d => e\n e => d\n  etc.\n```\n\nThe letters, which are not on the list of substitutes, stays in the encrypted text without changes.\n\nOther keys often used by Scouts:\n\n```\nPO-LI-TY-KA-RE-NU\nKA-CE-MI-NU-TO-WY\nKO-NI-EC-MA-TU-RY\nZA-RE-WY-BU-HO-KI\nBA-WO-LE-TY-KI-JU\nRE-GU-LA-MI-NO-WY\n```\n\n<h2>Task</h2>\n\nOur scouts had party yestarday and they had too much milk and cookies.

Fortunately they have some messages that are already encoded. \n\n\n<h2>Input</h2>\n\nThe function accepts has two arrays. <br/>\nThe `messages` string array consists of lowercase characters and whitespace characters. The strings on the `messages` array are scout's messages before encrytption. <br/>\nThe `secrets` string array consists of lowercase characters and whitespace characters.\nThe strings on the `messages` array are scout's messages after encrytption. \n\n<h2>Output</h2>\n\nReturn string should consists of lowercase characters only. The pairs of substitution should be ordered by the first letter of substitution. The letters in each pair should be in alphabethic order. <br>\n\n```\nga => incorret output (error: g is after a )\nag => correct output  \ndeag => incorrect output  (error: de is after ag)\nagde => correct output  \n```\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n\n```csharp\nstring[] messages = { \"dance on the table\", \"hide my beers\", \"scouts rocks\" };\nstring[] secretes = { \"egncd pn thd tgbud\" ,\"hked mr bddys\" ,\"scplts ypcis\" };\nFindTheKey(messages, secretes);   //=> agdeikluopry\n ```\n```javascript\n var messages = [ \"dance on the table\", \"hide my beers\", \"scouts rocks\" ];\n var secrets =  [ \"egncd pn thd tgbud\" ,\"hked mr bddys\" ,\"scplts ypcis\" ];\n findTheKey(messages, secrets);   //=> agdeikluopry\n ```\n```ruby\n messages = [ \"dance on the table\", \"hide my beers\", \"scouts rocks\" ];\n secrets =  [ \"egncd pn thd tgbud\" ,\"hked mr bddys\" ,\"scplts ypcis\" ];\n findTheKey(messages, secrets);   //=> agdeikluopry\n ```\n# GADERYPOLUKI collection\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/592a6ad46d6c5a62b600003f\" target=\"_blank\">GADERYPOLUKI cypher vol 1</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/592b7b16281da94068000107\" target=\"_blank\">GADERYPOLUKI cypher vol 2</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/592bdf59912f2209710000e9\" target=\"_blank\">GADERYPOLUKI cypher vol 3 - Missing Key</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td ><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/592ceef6af58a64c7f00003c\" target=\"_blank\">GADERYPOLUKI cypher vol 4 - Missing key madness</a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",

He is so smart and he doesn't need to remember the combinations. He has an algorithm to generate new passcodes on his Nokia cell phone. \n<br/>\n<img src='https://i.postimg.cc/2yCH2WhV/Nokia-3310.jpg' border='0' alt='postimage'/>\n<h2> Task </h2>\n\nCan you crack his numeric locks? Mr. Safety's treasures wait for you. Write an algorithm to open his numeric locks. Can you do it without his Nokia 3310? \n\n<h2>Input </h2>\n\nThe `str` or `message` (Python) input string consists of lowercase and upercase characters. It's a real object that you want to unlock.\n\n<h2>Output </h2>\nReturn a string that only consists of digits.\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n```\nunlock(\"Nokia\")  // => 66542\nunlock(\"Valut\")  // => 82588\nunlock(\"toilet\") // => 864538\n```",

Although I can not pose the problem with the fidelity it deserves I have implemented it so that it can be properly tested.\n\n#### Original problem\n\n##### There are N cards in a row and they can be face up or face down. A turn consists of taking two adjacent cards where the left one is face up and the right one can be face up or face down and flipping them both. Show that this process terminates.\n\n## Kata\n\nHere is how this problem is adapted for this kata ...\n\nYou will be provided with a string of random length.\n\n- A '1' represents card facing up. '0' represents cards facing down.\n\n- A turn consists of taking two adjacent cards where the left one is face up and the right one can be face up or face down and flipping them both.\n\n- If the only \"1\" that remains is the rightmost card, then just flip it on the final turn.\n\nReturn the <b>minimal</b> count of turns needed to turn all the cards facing down.\n\n- Only strings containing 1's and 0's are valid.\n\n- An invalid string should return 0 turns.\n\nEnjoy the film if you can!",

        "description": "# RoboScript #3 - Implement the RS2 Specification\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe story presented in this Kata Series is purely fictional; any resemblance to actual programming languages, products, organisations or people should be treated as purely coincidental.\n\n## About this Kata Series\n\nThis Kata Series is based on a fictional story about a computer scientist and engineer who owns a firm that sells a toy robot called MyRobot which can interpret its own (esoteric) programming language called RoboScript.  Naturally, this Kata Series deals with the software side of things (I'm afraid Codewars cannot test your ability to build a physical robot!).\n\n## Story\n\nLast time, you implemented the RS1 specification which allowed your customers to write more concise scripts for their robots by allowing them to simplify consecutive repeated commands by postfixing a non-negative integer onto the selected command.  For example, if your customers wanted to make their robot move 20 steps to the right, instead of typing `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`, they could simply type `F20` which made their scripts more concise.  However, you later realised that this simplification wasn't enough.  What if a set of commands/moves were to be repeated?  The code would still appear cumbersome.  Take the program that makes the robot move in a snake-like manner, for example.  The shortened code for it was `F4LF4RF4RF4LF4LF4RF4RF4LF4LF4RF4RF4` which still contained a lot of repeated commands.\n\n## Task\n\nYour task is to allow your customers to further shorten their scripts and make them even more concise by implementing the newest specification of RoboScript (at the time of writing) that is RS2.  RS2 syntax is a superset of RS1 syntax which means that all valid RS1 code from the previous Kata of this Series should still work with your RS2 interpreter.  The only main addition in RS2 is that the customer should be able to group certain sets of commands using round brackets.  For example, the last example used in the previous Kata in this Series:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nLF5RF3RF3RF7\n</pre> \n\n... can be expressed in RS2 as:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nLF5(RF3)(RF3R)F7\n</pre>\n\nOr ... \n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\n(L(F5(RF3))(((R(F3R)F7))))\n</pre>\n\nSimply put, your interpreter should be able to deal with nested brackets of any level.\n\nAnd of course, brackets are useless if you cannot use them to repeat a sequence of movements!  Similar to how individual commands can be postfixed by a non-negative integer to specify how many times to repeat that command, a sequence of commands grouped by round brackets `()` should also be repeated `n` times provided a non-negative integer is postfixed onto the brackets, like such:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\n(SEQUENCE_OF_COMMANDS)n\n</pre>\n\n... is equivalent to ... \n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nSEQUENCE_OF_COMMANDS...SEQUENCE_OF_COMMANDS (repeatedly executed \"n\" times)\n</pre>\n\nFor example, this RS1 program:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nF4LF4RF4RF4LF4LF4RF4RF4LF4LF4RF4RF4\n</pre>\n\n... can be rewritten in RS2 as:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nF4L(F4RF4RF4LF4L)2F4RF4RF4\n</pre>\n\nOr:\n\n<pre style=\"background: #161616; color: #c5c8c6; font-family: 'CamingoCode-Regular', monospace; display: block; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: auto\">\nF4L((F4R)2(F4L)2)2(F4R)2F4\n</pre>\n\nAll 4 example tests have been included for you.

        "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n```ruby\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n```javascript\n    isPolydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   // => True\n    isPolydivisible(\"123220\", 10) // => False\n    isPolydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  // => True\n    getPolydivisible(22, 10)      // => \"32\"\n    getPolydivisible(22, 16)      // => \"1A\"\n    getPolydivisible(42, 16)      // => \"42\"\n```\n```haskell\n    isPolydivisible \"1232\" 10   -- -> True\n    isPolydivisible \"123220\" 10 -- -> False\n    isPolydivisible \"123220\" 6  -- -> True\n    getPolydivisible 22 10      -- -> \"32\"\n    getPolydivisible 22 16      -- -> \"1A\"\n    getPolydivisible 42 16      -- -> \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```",

It is essentially an indoor, stacked car park. Parking structures may be heated if they are enclosed.\n\nDesign of parking structures can add considerable cost for planning new developments, and can be mandated by cities or states in new building parking requirements. Some cities such as London have abolished previously enacted minimum parking requirements (Source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-storey_car_park\">Wikipedia</a>)\n</pre>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianeyre/codewars/master/Ruby/Authored/carpark.jpg\"></center>\n\n## Task\n\n<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;white-space: -pre-wrap;white-space: -o-pre-wrap;word-wrap: break-word;\">\nYour task is to escape from the carpark using only the staircases provided to reach the exit.

        "description": "# Task\n Businesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. \n \n For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable `TUT-GLOP`. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing `310-GINO`. \n\n The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. `888-1200`). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:\n```\nA, B, and C map to 2\nD, E, and F map to 3\nG, H, and I map to 4\nJ, K, and L map to 5\nM, N, and O map to 6\nP, R, and S map to 7\nT, U, and V map to 8\nW, X, and Y map to 9\nletters can be uppercase or lowercase\n```\n\n There is no mapping for `Q(q) or Z(z)`. Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary. The standard form of `TUT-GLOP` is `888-4567`, the standard form of `310-GINO` is `310-4466`, and the standard form of `3-10-10-10` is `310-1010`.\n\n Two telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same standard form. (They dial the same number.)\n\n Given a list `phoneNumbers`, your task is to find the duplicate telephone number in the list. Return an array like this:\n\n `[\"310-1010:2\",\"487-3279:4\",\"888-4567:3\"]`\n\n The form of each element is `standard form + : + numbers of duplicate`\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` string array `phoneNumbers`\n\n  The list of the telephone numbers. Each telephone number consists of a string composed of decimal digits, letters (excluding Q and Z) and hyphens. Exactly seven of the characters in the string will be digits or letters.\n  \n - `[output]` a string array\n \n The duplicate telephone number list. Arrange the output string by telephone number in ascending lexicographical order. If there are no duplicates in the input return `[]`.\n\n - #Example\n \n For phoneNumbers = \n \n ```\n[\n\"7399425\",\n\"SEXY-GAL\",\n\"Sexy-GAL\",\n\"sexy-gal\",\n\"SEXY-425\",\n\"S-E-X-Y-G-A-L\"\n]\n```\n\n The output should be:\n ```\n [\"739-9425:6\"]\n```",

The team who wins the majority of the tricks will win points but the number of points varies. To determine the number of points, you must know which team called trump, how many tricks each team won, and if anyone went alone. Scoring is as follows:\n\nFor the team that called trump:\n\n- if they win 2 or less tricks -> other team wins 2 points\n\n- if they win 3 or 4 tricks -> 1 point\n\n- if they don't go alone and win 5 tricks -> 2 points\n\n- if they go alone and win 5 tricks -> 4 points\n\nOnly the team who called trump can go alone and you will notice that it only increases your points if you win all 5 tricks.\n\n\nYour job is to create a method to calculate the new score. When reading the arguments, team 1 is represented by 1 and team 2 is represented by 2. All scores will be stored with this order: { team1, team2 }.",

Sentences are divided by the aforementioned punctuation marks.\n\nFinally, the function will take an additional parameter consisting of an array/list of allowed words (upper or lower case) which are not to be replaced (the match has to be case insensitive).\n\nExtra cookies if you can do it all in some efficient way and/or using our dear regexes ;)\n\n**Note:** Absolutely not related to [a certain codewarrior I know](http://www.codewars.com/users/petegarvin1) :p",

        "description": "Earlier this year I was in a <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/regular-expresso/challenges\">contest on HackerRank</a> which included a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf\">code golf</a>-style <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/regular-expresso/challenges/winning-tic-tac-toe\">challenge</a> to write a regular expression of 50 or fewer characters that could determine whether or not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe\">tic tac toe</a> (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) board had a winner.\n\nI'm not going to force you to keep your regex at or under 50 characters here, or even force you to use a regex if you really don't want to (though if you really don't want to write a regex, why don't you do one of the <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/?q=tic+tac+toe\">other tic tac toe katas</a> here instead?), but why not challenge yourself, maybe learn something, and perhaps earn some Best Practices/Clever honor points for yourself as well?\n\nYour function will receive a string of nine \"X\", \"O\", and/or \"-\" characters representing the state of a tic tac toe board, for example the string \n```\n\"X-OXXXO-O\"\n```\nwould represent the board\n```\nX-O\nXXX\nO-O\n```\nwhere player X has won by getting three in a row horizontally on the middle row.\n\nYour function needs to return True/true/TRUE (depending on the language you're using) if either the X or the O player has won the game by getting three in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally; or False/false/FALSE if there is no winner.\n\nA few more examples:\n\n`\"---------\"` - False - no one has even made a move yet!\n\n`\"XOOOXXXXO\"` - False - no one got three in a row here.\n\n`\"OXO-XOX-O\"` - True - player O won by getting three in a row vertically in the third column.\n\nNote: Occasionally one of the random boards in the Test Suite will have two three-in-a-rows instead of one or none, and this still counts as a winning board. If the two three-in-a-rows belong to the same player, this just means that the second player played so badly that the first player's fifth and final move created two three-in-a-rows. If the two three-in-a-rows belong to different players, this just means that although one player won the game, afterward (as sometimes happens in real life) the other player made their mark in another square anyway, just because even though they already lost, they feel better doing that. :-)\n\nHave fun! \n",

And fan could somehow cope with it, if it was not for the very meager use of CG (Computer Graphic).\n\nLuckily, I am a simple man and every time Gatsu swings his humongous sword, that is enough to make me forget about everything else.\n\nYour goal is to build a Berserk Rater function that takes an array/list of events of each episode (as strings) and calculate a rating based on that: you start with a score of 0 (hey, it's a work from Miura-sensei, I have great expectations to satisfy!) and you have to:\n\n* subtract 2 each time \"CG\" is mentioned (case insensitive);\n* add 5 every time \"Clang\" is mentioned (case insensitive);\n* if a sentence has both \"Clang\" and \"CG\", \"Clang\" wins (add 5);\n* remove 1 every time neither is mentioned (I get bored easily, you know, particularly if you remove important parts and keep side character whining for half an episode).\n\nYou should then return a string, structured like this:\n\n* if the finale score is less than 0: \"worstest episode ever\";\n* if the score is between 0 and 10: the score itself, as a string;\n* if the finale score is more than 10: \"bestest episode ever\".\n\nExamples:\n```csharp\nKata.BerserkRater([\"is this the CG from a P2 game?\",\"Hell, no!

Like this:\n```\n|        | Ryu    | E.Honda  | Blanka  | Guile   |         |\n| Balrog | Ken    | Chun Li  | Zangief | Dhalsim | Sagat   |\n| Vega   | T.Hawk | Fei Long | Deejay  | Cammy   | M.Bison |\n```\nThe moves of the selection cursor are the same as before: rotate horizontally but stop vertically.\nWhen you find empty spaces (1 or more) you need to skip them if you approach them horizontally and get to the next selectable slot with the next fighter on the left or right; and if you approach them vertically you need to just stop and stay where you are.\n\nExample: if you are on Ryu and move left, you must get to Guile; if you are on Balrog and move up, you must stay on Balrog.\n\nNotice: I might put empty spaces *right in the middle* and the rectangular grids can be any size, not only 3x6, deal with this too.\n\n## What's new\n\nSo, let's resume what are the **new issues** in this harder version of the Kata:\n\n- The initial position might be any non-empty slot in the grid (given as input).\n- The characters grid (also given as input) might have any rectangular layout, not only 3 rows.\n- The grid might contain empty spaces, both on the borders or right in the middle.\n\n## Input\n\n~~~if-not:rust\n- Fighters grid;\n- Initial position;\n- List of moves.\n\nThe third input parameter is still the list of moves (all valid ones: left, right, up or down).\n~~~\n\n~~~if:rust\n- Fighters grid\n- Initial position as `Position`\n- List of moves as `Direction`\n\nThe `preloaded` module contains the following code:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub enum Direction {\n    Up,\n    Down,\n    Left,\n    Right,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]\npub struct Position {\n    pub x: usize,\n    pub y: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Position {\n    pub fn new(x: usize, y: usize) -> Self {\n        Self { x, y }\n    }\n}\n```\n~~~\n\n## Output\n\nThe output is the same as before: the list of characters that have been hovered by the selection cursor after each move, successful or not.\n\nHopefully test cases will complete my explanation.\n\n",

I'll give a special award for the first student that finds it.\" One of the students used his dictionary and spent all the night without sleeping, trying in vain to find the word. The next day, the word had not been found yet.\nThis student observed that the principal has a pattern in the features for the wanted words: \n\n- The word should have **n** vowels, may be repeated, for example: in \"engineering\", n = 5.\n\n- The word should have **m** consonants, may be repeated also: in \"engineering\", m = 6.\n\n- The word should not have some forbidden letters (in an array), forbid_letters\n\nYou will be provided with a list of words, WORD_LIST(python/crystal), wordList(javascript), wordList (haskell), $word_list(ruby), and you have to create the function, ```wanted_words()```, that receives the three arguments in the order given above, ```wanted_words(n, m, forbid_list)```and output an array with the word or an array, having the words in the order given in the pre-loaded list, in the case of two or more words were found.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n\n```haskell\nwantedWords 1 7 [\"m\", \"y\"] == [\"strength\"]\nwantedWords 3 7 [\"m\", \"y\"] == [\"afterwards\", \"background\", \"photograph\", \"successful\", \"understand\"]\n```\n\n```javascript\nwantedWords(1, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == [\"strength\"]\nwantedWords(3, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == ['afterwards', 'background', 'photograph', 'successful', 'understand']\n```\n\n```ruby\nwanted_words(1, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == [\"strength\"]\nwanted_words(3, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == ['afterwards', 'background', 'photograph', 'successful', 'understand']\n```\n\n```crystal\nwanted_words(1, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == [\"strength\"]\nwanted_words(3, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == ['afterwards', 'background', 'photograph', 'successful', 'understand']\n```\n\n```python\nwanted_words(1, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == [\"strength\"]\nwanted_words(3, 7, [\"m\", \"y\"]) == ['afterwards', 'background', 'photograph', 'successful', 'understand']\n```\n\nFor cases where no words are found the function will output an empty array.\n\n```haskell\nwantedWords 3 7  [\"a\", \"s\" , \"m\", \"y\"] == []\n```\n\n```javascript\nwantedWords(3, 7, [\"a\", \"s\" , \"m\", \"y\"]) == []\n```\n\n```ruby\nwanted_words(3, 7, [\"a\", \"s\" , \"m\", \"y\"]) == []\n```\n\n```crystal\nwanted_words(3, 7, [\"a\", \"s\" , \"m\", \"y\"]) == []\n```\n\n```python\nwanted_words(3, 7, [\"a\", \"s\" , \"m\", \"y\"]) == []\n```\n\nHelp our student to win this and the next challenges of the school. He needs to sure about a suspect that he has. That many times there are no solutions for what the principal is asking for.\nAll words have its letters in lowercase format.\nEnjoy it!\n",

Each subarray has both a string and a number within it. If the character code of any of the characters in the string matches the number, you get a mini win. Note you can only have one mini win per sub array.\n\nOnce you have counted all of your mini wins, compare that number to the other input provided (win). If your total is more than or equal to (win), return 'Winner!'. Else return 'Loser!'.\n\nAll inputs will be in the correct format. Strings on tickets are not always the same length.\n\n\n",

        "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking <font color=\"Lime\">green letters</font>.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything <font color=\"Yellow\">yellow</font>, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp\">this HTML colors names reference</a>.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet\">this Wikipedia description</a>. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal\">hexidecimal</a> or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```\n",

Since tennis isn't your favorite sport, you get bored right at the start of the first game and start looking for something to keep yourself entertained. Noticing the scoreboard, you realize you don't even know how many points have been won since the game started, so you decided to calculate this number. Given the current score, your goal is to find the number of points won in the current game.\n\nIf you are not familiar with tennis rules, here's a short description of its scoring system. Score calling is unique in tennis: each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value. The table of points won and corresponding calls is given below.\n```\n+----------------------+--------------------+\n| Number of points won | Corresponding call |\n+----------------------+--------------------+\n|          0           |      \"love\"        |\n+----------------------+--------------------+\n|          1           |       \"15\"         |\n+----------------------+--------------------+\n|          2           |       \"30\"         |\n+----------------------+--------------------+\n|          3           |       \"40\"         |\n+----------------------+--------------------+\n```\nThere's an additional rule to remember: `when players are tied by one or two points, the score is described as \"15-all\" and \"30-all\", respectively.`\n\nIt's guaranteed that no more than 5 points have been won so far, and the game is not over yet. It is also guaranteed that at least one point has been won.\n\n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n`[input]` string `score`\n\nA string in the format `<p1>-<p2>` representing a valid score, where `<p1>` is the first player's score, and `<p2>` is the second player's score.\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nThe number of points won so far.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `score = \"15-40\"`, the output should be 4.\n\nThe first player won `1` point, and the second `3`, so `1 + 3 = 4` points have been won.\n\nFor `score = \"30-all\"`, the output should be 4.\n\nThe players have won `2` points each.",

The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.\n\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex\n\n<hr>\n\n# Preface\n\nI first read about Soundex over 30 years ago. At the time it seemed to me almost  like  A.I. that you could just type in somebody's name the way it sounded and there was still a pretty good chance it could match the correct person record. That was about the same year as the first \"Terminator\" movie so it was easy for me to put 2 and 2 together and conclude that Arnie must have had some kind of futuristic Soundex chip in his titanium skull helping him to locate ```Serah Coner```... or was it ```Sarh Connor```... or maybe ```Sayra Cunnarr```...\n\n:-)\n\n<hr>\n\n# Task\n\nIn this Kata you will encode strings using a Soundex variation called \"American Soundex\" using the following (case insensitive) steps:\n\n* Save the first letter. Remove all occurrences of ```h``` and ```w``` except first letter.\n* Replace all consonants (include the first letter) with digits as follows:\n * ```b```, ```f```, ```p```, ```v``` = 1\n * ```c```, ```g```, ```j```, ```k```, ```q```, ```s```, ```x```, ```z``` = 2\n * ```d```, ```t``` = 3\n * ```l``` = 4\n * ```m```, ```n``` = 5\n * ```r``` = 6\n* Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit.\n* Remove all occurrences of ```a```, ```e```, ```i```, ```o```, ```u```, ```y``` except first letter.\n* If first symbol is a digit replace it with letter saved on step 1.\n* Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except first letter and 3 digits after it\n\n## Input\n\nA space separated string of one or more names. E.g.\n\n```Sarah Connor```\n\n## Output\n\nSpace separated string of equivalent <b>Soundex</b> codes (the first character of each code must be uppercase). E.g.\n\n```S600 C560```\n",

Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by one lever on the side of the machine as distinct from a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the player in debt and impoverished. Many modern machines are still equipped with a legacy lever in addition to the button.

For more information about the `chmod` command you can take a look at the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod).\n\n`chmod` provides two types of syntax that can be used for changing permissions. An absolute form using octal to denote which permissions bits are set e.g: 766.\nYour goal in this kata is to define the octal you need to use in order to set yout permission correctly.\n\nHere is the list of the permission you can set with the octal representation of this one.\n\n- User\n  - read (4)\n  - write (2)\n  - execute (1)\n- Group\n  - read (4)\n  - write (2)\n  - execute (1)\n- Other\n  - read (4)\n  - write (2)\n  - execute (1)\n  \nThe method take a hash in argument this one can have a maximum of 3 keys (`owner`,`group`,`other`). Each key will have a 3 chars string to represent the permission, for example the string `rw-` say that the user want the permission `read`, `write` without the `execute`.\nIf a key is missing set the permission to `---`\n\n**Note**: `chmod` allow you to set some special flags too (`setuid`, `setgid`, `sticky bit`) but to keep some simplicity for this kata we will ignore this one.

        "description": "For a given two numbers your mission is to derive a function that evaluates whether two given numbers are **abundant**, **deficient** or **perfect** and whether together they are **amicable**.\n\n\n\n### Abundant Numbers\nAn abundant number or excessive number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.\n\nThe integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16 (> 12).\n\n### Deficient Numbers\nA deficient number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is less than the number itself.\n\nThe first few deficient numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.\n\n### Perfect Numbers\nA perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. \n\nThe first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\n### Amicable Numbers\nAmicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.)\n\nFor example, the smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284); for the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.\n\n### The Function\n\nFor a given two numbers, derive function `deficientlyAbundantAmicableNumbers(num1, num2)` which returns a string with first and second word either abundant or deficient depending on whether `num1` or `num2` are abundant, deficient or perfect. The string should finish with either amicable or not amicable depending on the relationship between `num1` and `num2`.\n\ne.g. `deficientlyAbundantAmicableNumbers(220, 284)` returns `\"abundant deficient amicable\"` as 220 is an abundant number, 284 is a deficient number and amicable because 220 and 284 are an amicable number pair. \n\n\n\n\n\nSee Part 1 - [Excessively Abundant Numbers](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56a75b91688b49ad94000015)\n\nSee Part 2 - [The Most Amicable of Numbers](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56b5ebaa26fd54188b000018)",

Sure, if you stick around her home for a while you might see her creator open up her back and make a few tweaks and even see her recharge in the closet instead of sleeping in a bed.\n\nIn this kata, we're going to help Vicky keep track of the words she's learning.\n\nWrite a function, learnWord(word) ( LearnWord(word) in C# ) which is a method of the Robot object. The function should report back whether the word is now stored, or if she already knew the word.\n\nExample:\n````javascript\nvar vicky = new Robot();\nvicky.learnWord('hello') -> 'Thank you for teaching me hello'\nvicky.learnWord('abc') -> 'Thank you for teaching me abc'\nvicky.learnWord('hello') -> 'I already know the word hello'\nvicky.learnWord('wow!') -> 'I do not understand the input'\n````\n````java\nRobot vicky = new Robot();\nvicky.learnWord(\"hello\") -> \"Thank you for teaching me hello\"\nvicky.learnWord(\"abc\") -> \"Thank you for teaching me abc\"\nvicky.learnWord(\"hello\") -> \"I already know the word hello\"\nvicky.learnWord(\"wow!\") -> \"I do not understand the input\"\n````\n````csharp\nRobot vicky = new Robot();\nvicky.LearnWord(\"hello\"); // \"Thank you for teaching me hello\"\nvicky.LearnWord(\"abc\"); // \"Thank you for teaching me abc\"\nvicky.LearnWord(\"hello\"); // \"I already know the word hello\"\nvicky.LearnWord(\"wow!\"); // \"I do not understand the input\"\n````\n\nCase shouldn't matter.

The code should detect if k is a string , too, with the same result.\n```python\narr = [3, 3, -1, 10, 6, 8, -5, 4, 22, 31]\nk = \"Second\"\nstr_ = 'MaX'\ngiven_nth_value(arr, k, str_) -------> \"Incorrect value for k\"\n```\nIf we have more than one \"irregularity\" simultaneously the code should not output all the mistakes or invalid entries. It will output only one, checking in the following order:\n\n1) The value of k.\n\n2) The mode strings: \"max\" or \"min\".\n\n3) The array with the values.\n\nLet's see some cases with more than one invalid entry following the priority described above:\n```python\narr = []\nk = \"Second\"\nstr_ = 'MaX'\ngiven_nth_value(arr, k, str_) -------> \"Incorrect value for k\"\n\narr = []\nk = - 10\nstr_ = 'asdasd'\ngiven_nth_value(arr, k, str_) ------->\n\"Incorrect value for k\"\n\narr = [1,2,3,2,4,-5, 'Four']\nk = 29\nstr_ = 'kljklj'\ngiven_nth_value(arr, k, str_) -------> \"Valid entries: 'max' or 'min'\"\n\narr = [1,2,3,2,4,-5, 'Four']\nk = 29\nstr_ = 'MiN'\ngiven_nth_value(arr, k, str_) -------> \"Invalid entry list\"\n```\nFor all the cases the function will receive three arguments.\nEnjoy it!!\n",

But 617, 89927 are not of this type.\nIn general, if ```d1, d2, d3....``` are the digits of a certain number ```i``` \nExample:\n```( i = d1d2d3d4d5) so, d1 < d2 < d3 < d4 < d5```\n\n3) They cannot have digits that occurs twice or more. Example: 8991 should be discarded.\n\n4) The difference between neighbouring pairs of digits cannot exceed certain value. \nExample: If the difference between contiguous digits cannot exceed 2, so 1345, 23568 and 234578 pass this test. Other numbers like 1456, 389, 157 don't belong to that group because in the first number(1456), the difference between second and first digit 4 - 1 > 2; in the next one(389), we have 8 - 3 > 2; and see by yourself why 157 should be discarded.\nIn general, taking the example above of ```i = d1d2d3d4d5```:\n\n```\nd2 - d1 <= d;\n\nd3 - d2 <= d;\n\nd4 - d3 <= d;\n\nd5 - d4 <= d;\n```\n\nThe function should accept two arguments n and d; n is the upper limit of the range to work with(all the numbers should be less or equal than n), and d is maximum difference  between every pair of its contiguous digits. It's clear that 1 <= d <= 8.\n\nHere we have some cases:\n```\nsel_number(0,1) = 0 # n = 0, empty range\nsel_number(3, 1) = 0 # n = 3, numbers should be higher or equal than 12\nsel_number(13, 1) = 1 # only 12 fulfill the requirements\nsel_number(20, 2) = 2 # 12 and 13 are the numbers\nsel_number(30, 2) = 4 # 12, 13, 23 and 24 are the selected ones\nsel_number(44, 2) = 6 # 12, 13, 23, 24, 34 and 35 are valid ones\nsel_number(50, 3) = 12 # 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 36, 45, 46 and 47 are valid\n```\nCompare the last example with this one:\n```\nsel_number(47, 3) = 12 # 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 36, 45, 46 and 47 are valid \n```\n(because the instructions says the value of may be included if it fulfills the above constraints of course)\n\nHappy coding!!\n",

        "description": "Scheduling is how the processor decides which jobs (processes) get to use the processor and for how long. This can cause a lot of problems. Like a really long process taking the entire CPU and freezing all the other processes. One solution is Round-Robin, which today you will be implementing.\n\nRound-Robin works by queuing jobs in a First In First Out fashion, but the processes are only given a short slice of time. If a processes is not finished in that time slice, it yields the proccessor and goes to the back of the queue.\n\nFor this Kata you will be implementing the \n```javascript\n   function roundRobin(jobs, slice, index)\n```\n```python\n  def round_robin(jobs, time_slice, index):\n```\n```ruby\n  def roundRobin(jobs, slice, index)\n```\n\nIt takes in:\n\n    1. \"jobs\" a non-empty positive integer array. It represents the queue and clock-cycles(cc) remaining till the job[i] is finished.\n\n    2. \"slice\" a positive integer. It is the amount of clock-cycles that each job is given till the job yields to the next job in the queue.\n\n    3. \"index\" a positive integer. Which is the index of the job we're interested in.\n\nroundRobin returns:\n\n    1. the number of cc till the job at index is finished.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nroundRobin([10,20,1], 5, 0) \nat 0cc [10,20,1] jobs[0] starts\nafter 5cc [5,20,1] jobs[0] yields, jobs[1] starts\nafter 10cc [5,15,1] jobs[1] yields, jobs[2] starts\nafter 11cc [5,15,0] jobs[2] finishes, jobs[0] starts\nafter 16cc [0,15,0] jobs[0] finishes\n```\n\nso:\n```\nroundRobin([10,20,1], 5, 0) == 16\n```\n\n**You can assume that the processor can switch jobs between cc so it does not add to the total time.\n",

It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts.Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, both in its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.\n\n**Your Task :** \n\n    You have to create a function which takes a string as\n    input and returns it in the form of (L33T+Gr\u03b5\u03b5\u03ba)Case.\n    Note: The letters which are not being converted in \n    (L33T+Gr\u03b5\u03b5\u03ba)Case should be returned in the lowercase.\n\n**(L33T+Gr\u03b5\u03b5\u03ba)Case:**\n\n    A=\u03b1 (Alpha)      B=\u03b2 (Beta)      D=\u03b4 (Delta)\n    E=\u03b5 (Epsilon)    I=\u03b9 (Iota)      K=\u03ba (Kappa)\n    N=\u03b7 (Eta)        O=\u03b8 (Theta)     P=\u03c1 (Rho)\n    R=\u03c0 (Pi)         T=\u03c4 (Tau)       U=\u03bc (Mu)      \n    V=\u03c5 (Upsilon)    W=\u03c9 (Omega)     X=\u03c7 (Chi)\n    Y=\u03b3 (Gamma)\n    \n**Examples:**\n\n    CodeWars => c\u03b8\u03b4\u03b5\u03c9\u03b1\u03c0s\n    Kata => \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\n",

The idea for the game was published in 1967 by toy inventor Fred Kroll and it was introduced in 1978. The objective of the game is for each player to collect as many marbles as possible with their 'hippo' (a toy hippo model). (Source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Hungry_Hippos\">Wikipedia</a>)\n</pre>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianeyre/codewars/master/Ruby/Authored/hippo.jpg\" alt=\"Squares\"></center>\n\n# Task\n\n<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;white-space: -pre-wrap;white-space: -o-pre-wrap;word-wrap: break-word;\">\nYour task is to write a simple class called <font color=\"#A1A85E\">Game</font> that checks how many times a hippo has to leap into the centre of the arena to collect some food. You will be given an integer array called <font color=\"#A1A85E\">board</font> that defines where all the food can be found. You have to return an integer for the amount of leaps a hippo has to do to eat all of the food.\n</pre>\n\n# Rules\n<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;white-space: -pre-wrap;white-space: -o-pre-wrap;word-wrap: break-word;\">\n1.&nbsp; The <font color=\"#A1A85E\">board</font> array contains 0\u2019s for spaces and 1\u2019s for food\n\n2.&nbsp; The <font color=\"#A1A85E\">board</font> is n x n in size, where n is between 5 and 50.\n\n3.&nbsp; One leap consists of food items that are either <font color=\"#A1A85E\">horizontally</font> or <font color=\"#A1A85E\">vertically</font> connected to each other. If they are not connected, then another leap is needed.\n</pre>\n\n# Returns\n<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;white-space: -pre-wrap;white-space: -o-pre-wrap;word-wrap: break-word;\">\nReturn an integer for the amount of leaps needed to collect all of the food.\n</pre>\n\n# Example\n## Initialise\n```ruby\nboard = [[1,1,0,0,0],\n         [1,1,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,1,1],\n         [0,0,0,1,1]]\n\ngame = Game.new(board)\ngame.play()\n```\n```python\nboard = [[1,1,0,0,0],\n         [1,1,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,1,1],\n         [0,0,0,1,1]]\n\ngame = Game(board)\ngame.play()\n```\n```javascript\nboard = [[1,1,0,0,0],\n         [1,1,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,0,1,1],\n         [0,0,0,1,1]]\n\ngame = new Game(board)\ngame.play()\n```\n```csharp\nint[,] board = { { 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 },\n                 { 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 },\n                 { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },\n                 { 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 },\n                 { 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 } };\nGame game = new Game(board);\ngame.play();\n```\n## Result\nThere are 2 blocks of food connected horizontally or vertically so you must return 2.<br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianeyre/codewars/master/Ruby/Authored/hippo.png\"><br>\nGood luck and enjoy!\n\n# Kata Series\nIf you enjoyed this, then please try one of my other Katas.

        "description": "*Note: to get straight to the kata you may skip the first two paragraphs*\n\n## Introduction - JoJo's World\n\nYou may have heard about one of the most popular and influencial Japanese franchises, hailing from the 80s and still running with very good sale figures: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo's_Bizarre_Adventure\" target=\"_blank\">JoJo no Kimy\u014d na B\u014dken</a> AKA JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\n\nAnd if the notion of \"bizarre\" somehow eludes you, you could think of something like facing a basically immortal ancient superhuman being, worshipped and feared by both Aztecs and Romans who just got upgraded to demigod status and his showing off his new powers against you and your allies, which happen to include the largest American foundation, a nazi supercyborg and his loyal elite troopers.\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nBut I digress: point is that to date the author creates 8 sagas around 8 different JoJos: the one you could recognize in the video is <b>Jo</b>seph <b>Jo</b>estar, grand-son of the fist JoJo, <b>Jo</b>nathan <b>Jo</b>estar.\n\nAnd you could see a pattern already here: you are a JoJo if both your name and surname start with \"Jo-\". One more complication comes with the third JoJo: Jotaro Kujo (or, following Japanese use of putting the family name first: Ku<b>Jo</b> <b>Jo</b>taro). One last variant comes with the fifth JoJo: as it is of Italian descent (well, sorta of) and the traditional Italian alphabet has only 21 letters (lacking J, K, W, Y and X), the name that you would pronounce <b>Jo</b>rno <b>Jo</b>vanna has to be spelled \"Giorno Giovanna\".\n\nNow, the drill in this kata is rather easy: either create a regex expression or a function to find if a given name is a proper JoJo or not in boolean terms (true/True if it is valid, false/False otherwise).\n\nTo recap, you have a valid JoJo if:\n\n- both your firstname and your surname start with \"Jo-\"\n- your firstname starts with \"Jo-\" and your surname ends with \"-Jo\"\n- both your firstname and your surname start with \"Gio-\"\n\nNotes:\n- don't expect the to have a string formed by only two words joined by a space: strings may be of 1 word, 2 words, 3 words or more\n- lower- and uppercase will not matter here\n- consider the first word as the firstname and the last word as the surname\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n\"Joseph Joestar\"    --> valid JoJo name\n\"Dio Brando\"        --> invalid JoJo name\n\"George Joestar II\" --> invalid JoJo name (still cool, though)\n\"Giorno Giovanna\"   --> valid JoJo name\n\"Josuke Joestar\"    --> valid JoJo name (not his actual surname, but ok)\n\"Kars\"              --> invalid JoJo name\n\"Caesar Zeppeli\"    --> invalid JoJo name\n```\n\n\n## Final Notes\n\nThis kata is designed to give regex beginners a chance, so in your solutions try to be as **creative, elegant, extravagant** and **glamorous** as possible, in full homage of Hiroiko Araki, JoJo's creator and sole mangaka to work with institutions like the Louvre Museum of the famous luxury brand Gucci, not to mention <a href=\"http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_cultural_influences_of_JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure\" target=\"_blank\">how influential it has been on the Japanese pop culture</a> (the video above alone containes inspirations fort least 4 major beatem ups characters, including Guile of SFII fame).\n\n*All the characters named in this kata are copyright of their rightful owners and are mentioned only for educational purposes, a fair use according to the Berne convention.

First plans have been made and the community wants to decide on the best location for the coding school.\nIn order to make this decision data about the location of students and potential locations is collected. \n\n### Problem\nIn order to be able to attract and teach as many students as possible we want to minimize the total traveling distance for potential students. The streets system is organized in a traditional grid system and students can only travel horizontally or vertically (not diagonal).\n\nThe locations of interested students is given as an array with the first value of each entry presenting the x coordinate and the second value presenting the y coordinate:\n```javascript\nvar students = [[3,7],[2,2],[14,1], ...];\n```\n```ruby\nstudents = [[3,7],[2,2],[14,1], ...];\n```\n```python\nstudents = [[3,7],[2,2],[14,1], ...];\n```\nPotential locations are passed as an array of objects with an unique id, a x and y coordinate:\n```javascript\nvar locations = [{id: 1, x: 3, y: 4}, {id: 2, x: 8, y: 2}, ...];\n```\n```ruby\nlocations = [{\"id\"=> 1, \"x\"=> 3, \"y\"=> 4}, {\"id\"=> 2, \"x\"=> 8, \"y\"=> 2}, ...];\n```\n```python\nlocations = [{\"id\": 1, \"x\": 3, \"y\": 4}, {\"id\": 2, \"x\": 8, \"y\": 2}, ...];\n```\n\nYour task is now to evaluate which of the school locations would be best to minimize the distance for all potential students to the school.\n\nThe desired output should consist of a string indicating the ID of the best suitable location and the x and y coordinates in the following form:\n\n```\n\"The best location is number 1 with the coordinates x = 3 and y = 4\"\n```\n",

These addresses can be calculated using a bitwise AND operation on each bit.\n\n(The broadcast address is not used in this kata.)\n\n## Example\nA computer on a simple home network might have the following IP and subnet mask:\n```\nIP: 192.168.2.1\nSubnet: 255.255.255.0\n(CIDR Notation: 192.168.2.1 /24)\n```\nIn this example, the network block is: **192.168.2.0**. And the host identifier is: **0.0.0.1**. \n\n## bitwise AND \nTo calculate the network block and host identifier the bits in each octet are ANDed together. When the result of the AND operation is '1', the bit specifies a network address (instead of a host address).\n\nTo compare the first octet in our example above, convert both the numbers to binary and perform an AND operation on each bit:\n```\n11000000 (192 in binary)\n11111111 (255 in binary)\n--------------------------- (AND each bit)\n11000000 (192 in binary)\n```\nSo in the first octet, '**192**' is part of the network address. The host identifier is simply '**0**'.\n\nFor more information see the [Subnetwork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork) article on Wikipedia.\n",

        "description": " It is a well-known fact that behind every good comet is a UFO. These UFOs often come to collect loyal supporters from here on Earth. Unfortunately, they only have room to pick up one group of followers on each trip. They do, however, let the groups know ahead of time which will be picked up for each comet by a clever scheme: they pick a name for the comet which, along with the name of the group, can be used to determine if it is a particular group's turn to go (who do you think names the comets?). The details of the matching scheme are given below; your job is to write a program which takes the names of a group and a comet and then determines whether the group should go with the UFO behind that comet.\n\nBoth the name of the group and the name of the comet are converted into a number in the following manner: the final number is just the product of all the letters in the name, where \"A\" is 1 and \"Z\" is 26. For instance, the group \"USACO\" would be `21 * 19 * 1 * 3 * 15` = 17955. If the group's number mod 47 is the same as the comet's number mod 47, then you need to tell the group to get ready! (Remember that \"a mod b\" is the remainder left over after dividing a by b; 34 mod 10 is 4.)\n\nWrite a program which reads in the name of the comet and the name of the group and figures out whether according to the above scheme the names are a match, printing \"GO\" if they match and \"STAY\" if not. The names of the groups and the comets will be a string of capital letters with no spaces or punctuation, up to 6 characters long. \n\nExample:\n```javascript\ngroup = \"COMETQ\"\ncomet = \"HVNGAT\"\n\nride(group,comet) == \"GO\"\n```\n```coffeescript\ngroup = 'COMETQ'\ncomet = 'HVNGAT'\n\nride(group,comet) == 'GO'\n```\n```haskell\ngroup = \"COMETQ\"\ncomet = \"HVNGAT\"\n\nride group comet == Go\n```\n```clojure\n(def group \"COMETQ\")\n(def comet \"HVNGAT\")\n\n(ride group comet) ; returns \"GO\"\n```\n```ruby\ngroup = \"COMETQ\"\ncomet = \"HVNGAT\"\n\nride(group,comet) == \"GO\"\n```\n\nConverting the letters to numbers:\n```\nC  O   M   E  T   Q\t\n3  15  13  5  20  17\t\n\nH  V   N   G  A  T\n8  22  14  7  1  20\t\n```\nthen calculate the product mod 47:\n```\n3 * 15 * 13 * 5 * 20 * 17 = 994500 mod 47 = 27\n8 * 22 * 14 * 7 *  1 * 20 = 344960 mod 47 = 27\n```\nBecause both products evaluate to 27 (when modded by 47), the mission is 'GO'.

        "description": "This kata is part one of precise fractions series (see pt. 2: http://www.codewars.com/kata/precise-fractions-pt-2-conversion).\n\nWhen dealing with fractional values, there's always a problem with the precision of arithmetical operations. So lets fix it!\n\nYour task is to implement class ```Fraction``` that takes care of simple fraction arithmetics. Requirements:\n\n* class must have two-parameter constructor `Fraction(numerator, denominator)`; passed values will be non-zero integers, and may be positive or negative.\n* two conversion methods must be supported:\n * `toDecimal()` returns decimal representation of fraction\n * `toString()` returns string with fractional representation of stored value in format:\n\n    [ SIGN ] [ WHOLES ] [ NUMERATOR / DENOMINATOR ]\n   * **Note**: each part is returned only if it is available and non-zero, with the only possible space character going between WHOLES and fraction. Examples: '-1/2', '3', '-5 3/4'\n    \n* The fractional part must always be normalized (ie. the numerator and denominators must not have any common divisors).\n* Four operations need to be implemented: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide`. Each of them may take integers as well as another `Fraction` instance as an argument, and must return a new `Fraction` instance.\n* Instances must be immutable, hence none of the operations may modify either of the objects it is called upon, nor the passed argument.\n \n #### Python Notes\n* If one integer is passed into the initialiser, then the fraction should be assumed to represent an integer not a fraction.\n* You must implement the standard operator overrides `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__div__`, in each case you should support `other` being an `int` or another instance of `Fraction`.\n* Implement `__str__` and `to_decimal` in place of `toString` and `toDecimal` as described above.",

Beings of all worlds come together to compete in several interesting sports, like nroogring, fredling and buzzing (the beefolks love the last one). However, there's also the traditional marathon run.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been cheaters in the last years, and the committee decided to place sensors on the track. Committees being committees, they've come up with the following rule:\n\n> A sensor should be placed every 3 and 5 meters from the start, e.g.\n> at 3m, 5m, 6m, 9m, 10m, 12m, 15m, 18m\u2026.\n\nSince you're responsible for the track, you need to buy those sensors. Even worse, you don't know how long the track will be! And since there might be more than a single track, and you can't be bothered to do all of this by hand, you decide to write a program instead.\n\n## Task\nReturn the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 __below__ a number. Being the _galactic_ games, the tracks can get rather large, so your solution should work for _really_ large numbers (greater than 1,000,000).\n\n### Examples\n```haskell\nsolution 10 `shouldBe` 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9\nsolution 20 `shouldBe` 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18\n```\n```javascript\nsolution (10) // => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9\nsolution (20) // => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18\n```\n```python\nsolution (10) # => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9\nsolution (20) # => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18\n```\n```ruby\nsolution(10) # => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9\nsolution(20) # => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18\n```",

This magic trick is based on a mathematic algorithm: the Zeckendorf theorem:\n```\nEvery positive integer can be expressed uniquely as a sum of distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n```\n\n**Don't be afraid, you don't need to understand the theorem to solve this kata.**\n\n-------------------------\n#Magic Trick Description\n\nHere is how the magic trick work:\n\n1. Ask the spectator to choose a number between 0 and 100 (included)\n2. Give a *special* set of card to the spectator, these cards contains a list of numbers. Here is what the cards look like: [https://blogdemaths.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/cartes-magiques.pdf](CLICK)\n3. Ask the spectator to give you back only the cards where his number is written on it.\n4. You can guess the number of your spectator\n\n-------------------------\n#Magic Trick Explanation\n\nYou just need to sum the first number on each card and TADAM. In practice you could ask numbers much higher (with 10 cards it can go up to 231) but that would make really long cards.\n\n-------------------------\n#Objective\n\nWe will consider that each presented card has an \"index\" on it to recognize it. Those cards are already given to you. Write a class magicZ with 2 functions ```gueZZ([indexes of card])``` and ```getMagicZindex(n)```.\n\n- ```gueZZ(indexes)``` takes an array being the index of each card and return the guessed number\n- ```getMagicZindex(n)``` takes a number and return the list of indexes for this value (the number can be higher than 100)\n\n\n##Example:\nI chose number 70:\n\n- ```gueZZ([1,5,8]) === 70```\n- ```getMagicZindex(70) = [1,5,8]```\n\n##Note\nThe spectator is always going to try to trick. Be prepared to receive duplicated cards (ignore the duplicates) or fewer cards than expected (respond with 0).\n\n##Next\nIf you think this kata was too simple, you can try to generate the cards used in this kata, here: http://www.codewars.com/kata/zeckendorf-cards-generator .\n\n\nGood Luck, Don't forget to up vote if you like, thanks\n\n*IVBakker*",

For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) \n[\n (i<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>1</sub>),\n (i<sub>2</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>),\n \u2026,\n (i<sub>n</sub>, s<sub>n</sub>)\n], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character s<sub>x</sub> i<sub>x</sub> times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values s<sub>i</sub> and s<sub>i+1</sub> should differ.\n\n## Examples\n\nAs the article states, RLE is a _very_ simple form of data compression.

        "description": "There are 8 balls numbered from 0 to 7. \nSeven of them have the same weight. One is heavier. Your task is to find its number.\n\nYour function ```findBall``` will receive single argument - ```scales``` object. The ```scales``` object contains an internally stored array of 8 elements (indexes 0-7), each having the same value except one, which is greater. It also has a public method named ```getWeight(left, right)``` which takes two arrays of indexes and returns -1, 0, or 1 based on the accumulation of the values found at the indexes passed are heavier, equal, or lighter.\n\n```getWeight``` returns:\n\n```-1``` if **left** pan is heavier\n\n```1``` if **right** pan is heavier\n\n```0``` if both pans weight the same\n\nExamples of ```scales.getWeight()``` usage:\n\n```scales.getWeight([3], [7])``` returns ```-1``` if ball 3 is heavier than ball 7, ```1``` if ball 7 is heavier, or ```0``` i these balls have the same weight.\n\n```scales.getWeight([3, 4], [5, 2])``` returns ```-1``` if weight of balls 3 and 4 is heavier than weight of balls 5 and 2 etc.\n\nSo where's the catch, you may ask. Well - the scales is very old. You can use it only **3 TIMES** before the scale breaks.\n\n``` if:python,ruby,crystal\n**Note** - Use `scales.get_weight()` in the Python, Crystal and Ruby versions.\n```\n``` if:ocaml\n**Note** - Use `scales#get_weight` in the OCaml version.\n```\n\nToo easy ?

        "description": "### Task\nThe __dot product__ is usually encountered in linear algebra or scientific computing. It's also called __scalar product__ or __inner product__ sometimes:\n\n> In mathematics, the __dot product__, or __scalar product__ (or sometimes __inner product__ in the context of Euclidean space), is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number. <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dot_product&oldid=629717691)</cite>\n\nIn our case, we define the dot product algebraically for two vectors `a = [a1, a2, \u2026, an]`, `b = [b1, b2, \u2026, bn]` as \n    \n    dot a b = a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + \u2026 + an * bn.\nYour task is to find permutations of `a` and `b`, such that `dot a b` is minimal, and return that value. For example, the dot product of `[1,2,3]` and `[4,0,1]` is minimal if we switch `0` and `1` in the second vector.\n\n### Examples\n```haskell\nminDot [1,2,3,4,5] [0,1,1,1,0]  = 6\nminDot [1,2,3,4,5] [0,0,1,1,-4] = -17\nminDot [1,3,5]     [4,-2,1]     = -3\n```\n```javascript\nminDot( [1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,1,1,0] ) = 6\nminDot( [1,2,3,4,5], [0,0,1,1,-4]) = -17\nminDot( [1,3,5]    , [4,-2,1]    ) = -3\n```\n```python\nmin_dot([1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,1,1,0] ) = 6\nmin_dot([1,2,3,4,5], [0,0,1,1,-4]) = -17\nmin_dot([1,3,5]    , [4,-2,1]    ) = -3\n```\n```clojure\n(minDot [1 2 3 4 5] [0 1 1 1 0]) ; returns 6\n(minDot [1 2 3 4 5] [0 0 1 1 -4]) ; returns -17\n(minDot [1 3 5]     [4 -2 1]) ; returns -3\n```\n```ruby\nmin_dot([1,2,3,4,5], [0,1,1,1,0] ) = 6\nmin_dot([1,2,3,4,5], [0,0,1,1,-4]) = -17\nmin_dot([1,3,5]    , [4,-2,1]    ) = -3\n```\n\n### Remarks\nIf the list or array is empty, `minDot` should return 0. All arrays or lists will have the same length. Also, for the dynamically typed languages, all inputs will be valid lists or arrays, you don't need to check for `undefined`, `null` etc.\n\nNote: This kata is inspired by [GCJ 2008](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32016/dashboard#s=p0).",

        "description": "Zonk is an addictive dice game. In each round the player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations of them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to their hand and re-roll remaining dice or save the score. Dice in the player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - the situation is called \"zonk\". The player who rolled zonk loses all points in that round and the next player takes a turn. So it's up to the player to decide when to re-roll and when to stop and keep their score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate  the current roll and return the maximum number of points that can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made, the function should return `0` (see Note below). The function should not modify the input.\n\n_Note: a previous version of this Kata required to return \"Zonk\" if no combinations possible, but mixing different return types is a bad practice. For backwards compatibility, \"Zonk\" is accepted as a valid result and is considered zero in some languages._\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n<table>\n<tr><td>Combination</td><td>Example roll</td><td>Points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Straight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)</td><td>6 3 1 2 5 4</td><td>1000 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three pairs of any dice</td><td>2 2 4 4 1 1</td><td>750 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three of 1</td><td>1 4 1 1</td><td>1000 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three of 2</td><td>2 3 4 2 2</td><td>200 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three of 3</td><td>3 4 3 6 3 2</td><td>300 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three of 4</td><td>4 4 4</td><td>400 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three of 5</td><td>2 5 5 5 4</td><td>500 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Three of 6</td><td>6 6 2 6</td><td>600 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Four of a kind</td><td>1 1 1 1 4 6</td><td>2 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Five of a kind</td><td>5 5 5 4 5 5</td><td>3 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Six of a kind</td><td>4 4 4 4 4 4</td><td>4 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Every 1</td><td>4 3 1 2 2</td><td>100 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Every 5</td><td>5 2 6</td><td>50 points</td></tr>\n</table>\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind `2` plus 100 for single `1` die)\n\n<h2>Examples:</h2>\n\n```\n[1,2,3]       =>  returns 100  = points from one 1\n[3,4,1,1,5]   =>  returns 250  = points from two 1 and one 5\n[2,3,2,3,3,2] =>  returns 500  = three of 2 + three of 3\n[1,1,1,1,1,5] =>  returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n[2,3,4,3,6,6] =>  returns 0    = Zonk, no combinations here\n[2,2,6,6,2,2] =>  returns 400  = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n[1,3,4,3,4,1] =>  returns 750  = three pairs\n[3,3,3,3]     =>  returns 600  = four of 3\n[1,2,3,4,5]   =>  returns 150  = it's not straight\n```\n\nOf course, in the real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from a roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but this task is just to calculate the maximum possible score from a single roll.\n\nP.S.

        "description": "The AKS algorithm for testing whether a number is prime is a polynomial-time test based on the following theorem: \n\nA number p is prime if and only if all the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of `(x \u2212 1)^p \u2212 (x^p \u2212 1)` are divisible by `p`.\n\nFor example, trying `p = 3`:\n\n     (x \u2212 1)^3 \u2212 (x^3 \u2212 1) = (x^3 \u2212 3x^2 + 3x \u2212 1) \u2212 (x^3 \u2212 1) = \u2212 3x^2 + 3x \n    \nAnd all the coefficients are divisible by 3, so 3 is prime.\n\nYour task is to code the test function, wich will be given an integer and should return true or false based on the above theorem. You should efficiently calculate every coefficient one by one and stop when a coefficient is not divisible by p to avoid pointless calculations. The easiest way to calculate coefficients is to take advantage of binomial coefficients: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient and pascal triangle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle . \n\nYou should also take advantage of the symmetry of binomial coefficients. You can look at these kata: http://www.codewars.com/kata/pascals-triangle and http://www.codewars.com/kata/pascals-triangle-number-2\n\nThe kata here only use the simple theorem. The general AKS test is way more complex.  The simple approach is a good exercie but impractical. The general AKS test will be the subject of another kata as it is one of the best performing primality test algorithms.\n\nThe main problem of this algorithm is the big numbers emerging from binomial coefficients in the polynomial expansion. As usual Javascript reach its limit on big integer very fast. (This simple algorithm is far less performing than a trivial algorithm here). You can compare the results with those of this kata: http://www.codewars.com/kata/lucas-lehmer-test-for-mersenne-primes Here, javascript can barely treat numbers bigger than 50, python can treat M13 but not M17.\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. Selector describes which element it matches.\n\nSometimes element is matched to multiple selectors. In this case, element inherits multiple styles, from each rule it matches. Rules can override each other. To solve this problem, each selector has it's own 'specificity' - e.g. weight. The selector with greater specificity overrides the other selector.\n\nYour task is to calculate the weights of two selectors and determine which of them will beat the other one.\n\n# Examples \n```\n\"body p\",  \"div\"     --->  return \"body p\"\n\".class\",  \"#id\"     --->  return \"#id\"\n\"div.big\", \".small\"  --->  return \"div.big\"\n\".big\",    \".small\"  --->  return \".small\" (because it appears later)\n```\n\nFor simplicity, all selectors in test cases are CSS1-compatible, test cases don't include pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, attribute selectors, etc. Below is an explanation on how to weight two selectors. You can read more about specificity [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/).\n\nThe simplest selector type is `tagname` selector. It writes as a simple  alphanumeric identifier: eg `body`, `div`, `h1`, etc. It has the least weight. If selectors have multiple elements - the selector with more elements win. For example, `body p` beats `div`, because it refers to 2 (nested) elements rather than 1.\n\nAnother simple selector is `.class` selector. It begins with dot and refer to element with specific `class` attribute. Class selectors can also be applied to tagname selectors, so `div.red` refer to `<div class=\"red\">` element. They can be grouped, for example, `.red.striped`. Class selector beats tagname selector.\n\nThe most weighted selector type in stylesheet is `#id` selector. It begins with hash sign and refer to element with specific `id` attribute. It can also be standalone, or applied to an element. Id selector beats both selector types.\n\nAnd the least weighted selector is `*`, which has no specificity and can be beat by any other selector.\n\nSelectors can be combined, for example, `body #menu ul li.active` refers to `li` element with `class=\"active\"`, placed inside `ul` element, placed inside element width `id=\"menu\"`, placed inside `body`.\n\nSpecificity calculation is simple. \n\n- Selector with more #id selectors wins.\n- If both are same, the winner is selector with more .class selectors.\n- If both are same, selector with more elements wins.\n- If all of above values are same, the winner is selector that appear last.\n\nFor example, let's represent the number of ``#id`` , ``.class``, ``tagname`` selectors as array (in order from worst to best):\n\n|Selector|Specificity (#id,.class,tagname)|\n|--------|--------------------------------|\n| * |0, 0, 0|\n| span | 0, 0, 1 |\n| body p | 0, 0, 2 |\n| .green | 0, 1, 0 |\n| apple.yellow | 0, 1, 1 |\n| div.menu li | 0, 1, 2 |\n| .red .orange | 0, 2, 0 |\n| div.big .first | 0, 2, 1 |\n| #john | 1, 0, 0 |\n| div#john | 1, 0, 1 |\n| body #john span | 1, 0, 2 |\n| menu .item #checkout.active | 1, 2, 1 |\n| #foo div#bar.red .none | 2, 2, 1 |\n",

        "description": "For a general presentation of Cycle detection Problem see this kata: http://www.codewars.com/kata/5416f1834c24604c46000696\n\nThe greedy algorithm for cycle detection is trivial but ask for storing at least `$\\mu + \\lambda$` values and perform a comparison on each pair of values, resulting in an overall quadratic complexity. We want to reduce space and time complexity to use cycle detection efficiently.  \n\nFloyd's develloped a pointer algorithm for cycle detection: Tortoise and the Hare. \nThis algorithm uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds. Like the tortoise and the hare in Aesop's Fable.\n\nWe will now work directly with `$x_0$` and `$f$`. \n\nThere is 3 phases for the algorithm:\n\n1) Main phase of algorithm: starting with tortoise = `$x_1$`, hare = `$x_2$`, \n   move the tortoise by one `$tortoise=f(tortoise)$` and the hare by two              `$hare=f(f(hare))$`. They will eventually be both in the loop and as the distance between them is increasing it will reach a multiple of `$\\lambda$` and they will get the same value. \n\n2) At this point the tortoise position has walked `$\\nu$` , the hare `$2\\nu$`, the distance between them is both `$\\nu$` and `$k\\lambda$`. So hare starting at his last position moving in cycle one step at a time and tortoise at `$x_0$` moving towards the cycle will intersect at the beginning of the cycle. This is how to find `$\\mu$`. \n\n3) Now that they are in the same position, tortoise stay still and hare move in the circle one step at a time, lambda is incremented at each step. So when they meet again we will have `$\\lambda$`. \n\nYou will build a function that take `$f$` and `$x_0$` as parameters and return an array [mu,lambda]. All the function will be periodic after some point. \n\nWe can find an application of this algorithm for greater purpose, as for exemple Pollard Rho Algorithm for integer factorisation. \n\nThis kata is followed by: http://www.codewars.com/kata/cycle-detection-brents-tortoise-and-hare",

Unfortunately, fish are often seen as high maintenance. Contrary to popular belief, fish actually reduce pond maintenance as they graze on string algae and bottom feed from the pond floor.

You can only eat fish that are the same size or smaller than yourself. \nYou must create a function called <font color=\"#A1A85E\">fish</font> that takes a shoal of fish as an input string.

Whichever robot has the best speed, will attack first with one battle tactic. \n\nYour job is to decide who wins.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\n robot1 = {\n  \"name\": \"Rocky\",\n  \"health\": 100,\n  \"speed\": 20,\n  \"tactics\": [\"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"]\n }\n robot2 = {\n   \"name\": \"Missile Bob\",\n   \"health\": 100,\n   \"speed\": 21,\n   \"tactics\": [\"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"]\n }\n tactics = {\n   \"punch\": 20,\n   \"laser\": 30,\n   \"missile\": 35\n }\n \n fight(robot1, robot2, tactics) -> \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n```coffeescript\nrobot1 =\n  name: \"Rocky\"\n  health: 100\n  speed: 20\n  tactics: [\n    \"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"\n  ]\nrobot2 =\n  name: \"Missile Bob\"\n  health: 100\n  speed: 21\n  tactics: [\n    \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"\n  ]\ntactics =\n  punch: 20\n  laser: 30\n  missile: 35\n \nfight(robot1, robot2, tactics) # \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n```ruby\nrobot1 = {\n  \"name\" => \"Rocky\",\n  \"health\" => 100,\n  \"speed\" => 20,\n  \"tactics\" => [\"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"]\n }\n robot2 = {\n   \"name\" => \"Missile Bob\",\n   \"health\" => 100,\n   \"speed\" => 21,\n   \"tactics\" => [\"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"]\n }\n tactics = {\n   \"punch\" => 20,\n   \"laser\" => 30,\n   \"missile\" => 35\n }\n \n fight(robot1, robot2, tactics) # \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n```java\n  robot1.getName() => \"Rocky\"\n  robot1.getHealth() => 100\n  robot1.getSpeed() => 20\n  robot1.getTactics() => [\"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"]\n    \n  robot2.getName() => \"Missile Bob\"\n  robot2.getHealth() => 100\n  robot2.getSpeed() => 21\n  robot2.getTactics() => [\"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"]\n \n  tactics = {\n    \"punch\" => 20,\n    \"laser\" => 30,\n    \"missile\" => 35\n  }\n \n fight(Robot robot1, Robot robot2, Map<String, Integer> tactics) -> \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n```python\n robot_1 = {\n  \"name\": \"Rocky\",\n  \"health\": 100,\n  \"speed\": 20,\n  \"tactics\": [\"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"]\n }\n robot_2 = {\n   \"name\": \"Missile Bob\",\n   \"health\": 100,\n   \"speed\": 21,\n   \"tactics\": [\"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"]\n }\n tactics = {\n   \"punch\": 20,\n   \"laser\": 30,\n   \"missile\": 35\n }\n \n fight(robot_1, robot_2, tactics) -> \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n\nrobot2 uses the first tactic, \"missile\" because he has the most speed. This reduces robot1's health by 35. Now robot1 uses a punch, and so on. \n\n**Rules**\n\n- A robot with the most speed attacks first. If they are tied, the first robot passed in attacks first.\n- Robots alternate turns attacking. Tactics are used in order.\n- A fight is over when a robot has 0 or less health or both robots have run out of tactics.\n- A robot who has no tactics left does no more damage, but the other robot may use the rest of his tactics.\n- If both robots run out of tactics, whoever has the most health wins. If one robot has 0 health, the other wins. Return the message \"{Name} has won the fight.\"\n- If both robots run out of tactics and are tied for health, the fight is a draw. Return \"The fight was a draw.\"\n\n**To Java warriors**\n\n`Robot` class is immutable.\n\n<div style=\"width: 320px; text-align: center; color: white; border: white 1px solid;\">\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n</div>\n<div>\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-1-how-many-licks-does-it-take'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #1:</span> How Many Licks Does It Take</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-2-help-alf-find-his-spaceship'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #2:</span> Help Alf Find His Spaceship</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-3-punky-brewsters-socks'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #3:</span> Punky Brewster's Socks</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-4-legends-of-the-hidden-temple'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #4:</span> Legends of the Hidden Temple</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-5-you-cant-do-that-on-television'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #5:</span> You Can't Do That on Television</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-6-rock-em-sock-em-robots'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #6:</span> Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-7-shes-a-small-wonder'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #7:</span> She's a Small Wonder</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-8-the-secret-world-of-alex-mack'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #8:</span> The Secret World of Alex Mack</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-9-down-in-fraggle-rock'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #9:</span> Down in Fraggle Rock </a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-10-captain-planet'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #10:</span> Captain Planet </a><br />\n\n\n</div>\n",

This function takes as parameters the current list of 0 and 1 to print, the max level that you can reach (number of iterations) and the length of initial array.\n\n```python\ndef printRule30(list_, maxLvl, startLen):\n  ...\n```\n\nThe last two parameters are optional and are useful if you are printing each line of the iteration to center the result like this:\n\n\u2591\u2591\u2593\u2591\u2591  -> step 1  \n\u2591\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2591  -> step 2  \n\u2593\u2593\u2591\u2591\u2593  -> step 3  \n\nIf you pass only the array of 0 and 1 the previous result for each line will be like this:\n\n\u2593 -> step 1   \n\u2593\u2593\u2593 -> step 2  \n\u2593\u2593\u2591\u2591\u2593 -> step 3 \n\n**Note:** the function can print only the current list that you pass to it, so you have to use it in the proper way during the interactions of the rule 30.\n~~~\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n#### Encodings\n\n`purity: LetRec`  \n`numEncoding: Scott`  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` and deconstructor `foldr` for your `List` encoding  \n~~~\n",

Given an edge with length = 1, the number of cannonballs contained in the base triangle (the triangular number) will be 1, and the number of cannonballs you would be able to stack in a regular tetrahedron will be 1.\n\nThe table for the series is this:\n\n(edge's length -> triangular number -> \"cannonball number\")\n```\n 1 ->   1 ->    1\n 2 ->   3 ->    4\n 3 ->   6 ->   10\n 4 ->  10 ->   20\n 5 ->  15 ->   35\n 6 ->  21 ->   56\n 7 ->  28 ->   84\n 8 ->  36 ->  120\n 9 ->  45 ->  165\n10 ->  55 ->  220\n11 ->  66 ->  286\n12 ->  78 ->  364\n13 ->  91 ->  455\n14 -> 105 ->  560\n15 -> 120 ->  680\n16 -> 136 ->  816\n17 -> 153 ->  969\n18 -> 171 -> 1140\n19 -> 190 -> 1330\n20 -> 210 -> 1540 \n```\nYou can see some properties here:\n\n1. The nth triangular number is: ```t(n) = n + t(n-1)```\n2. The nth cannonball number is: ```c(n) = t(n) + c(n-1)```\n\nHint: Remember that, even though, we are talking about tetrahedrons the key number here is not 4 but 3.\n\n*** Please, don't worry about the parameters. You will only receive positive integers.\n",

However, the method of sorting has a twist to it:\n* All words that begin with a lower case letter should be at the beginning of the sorted sentence, and sorted in ascending order.\n* All words that begin with an upper case letter should come after that, and should be sorted in descending order.\n\nIf a word appears multiple times in the sentence, it should be returned multiple times in the sorted sentence. Any punctuation must be discarded.\n\n## Example\n\nFor example, given the input string `\"Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and Connecticut!\"`, your method should return `\"and land land of of the Vermont Thirteen Old Massachusetts Land Connecticut\"`. Lower case letters are sorted `a -> l -> l -> o -> o -> t` and upper case letters are sorted `V -> T -> O -> M -> L -> C`.",

You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There is however one hitch: exactly one term from the original series is missing from the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the original AP.  Find the missing term.  \n\nYou have to write a function that receives a list, list size will always be at least 3 numbers. The missing term will never be the first or last one.\n\n## Example\n```php\nfindMissing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11]) == 7\n```\n```csharp\nKata.FindMissing(new List<int> {1, 3, 5, 9, 11}) => 7\n```\n```fsharp\nfindMissing [| 1; 3; 5; 9; 11 |] = 7\n```\n```python\nfind_missing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11]) == 7\n```\n```swift\nfind_missing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11]) == 7\n```\n```ruby\nfindMissing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11]) == 7\n```\n```c\nfind_missing((const int[]){1,3,5,9,11}, 5)  => 7\n```\n```nasm\nnums:  dw  1,3,5,9,11\n\nmov rdi, nums\nmov rsi, 5\ncall find_missing    ; EAX <- 7\n```\n```factor\n{ 1 3 5 9 11 } find-missing ! => 7\n```\n\nPS: This is a sample question of the facebook engineer challenge on interviewstreet.\nI found it quite fun to solve on paper using math, derive the algo that way.\nHave fun!\n",

        "description": "**Introduction**\n\nOrdinal numbers are used to tell the position of something in a list. Unlike regular numbers, they have a special suffix added to the end of them.\n\n\n**Task**\n\nYour task is to write the `ordinal(number, brief)` function. `number` will be an integer. You need to find the ordinal suffix of said number.\n\n`brief` is an optional parameter and defaults to `false`. When using brief notation, `nd` and `rd` use `d` instead. All others are the same.\n\n`ordinal(number, brief)` should return a string containing those two characters (or one character) that would be tagged onto the end of the number.\n\nThe last two digits determine the ordinal suffix.\n\n**Notation for general notation**\n<pre>\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\nth st nd rd th th th th th th\n</pre>\n\n**Notation for brief notation**\n<pre>\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\nth st d  d th th th th th th\n</pre>\n\n**However, when the last two digits of the number are 11, 12, or 13, `th` is used instead of `st`,`nd`,`rd` respectively.**\n\n**Examples**\n<pre>\n*General\n1 - 1st\n2 - 2nd\n3 - 3rd\n5 - 5th\n11- 11th\n149 - 149th\n903 - 903rd\n</pre>\n<pre>\n*Brief\n1 - 1st\n2 - 2d\n3 - 3d\n5 - 5th\n11- 11th\n149 - 149th\n903 - 903d\n</pre>\n\n**Notes**\n\n- Numbers might be passed in replacement of booleans, so `false` may be passed in as `0` and true may be passed in as `1`.",

This grade level is an approximation for what schoolchildren are able to understand a piece of text. For example, a piece of text with a grade level of 7 can be read by seventh-graders and beyond.\n\nThe way to calculate the grade level is as follows:\n\n    (0.39 * average number of words per sentence) + (11.8 * average number of syllables per word) - 15.59\n\nWrite a function that will calculate the Flesch\u2013Kincaid grade level for any given string. Return the grade level rounded to two decimal points.\n\nIgnore hyphens, dashes, apostrophes, parentheses, ellipses and abbreviations.\n\nRemember that the text can contain more than one sentence: code accordingly!\n\n**HINT**: Count the number of vowels as an approximation for the number of syllables, but count groups of vowels as one (e.g. `deal` is one syllable). **Do not** count `y` as a vowel!\n\n\n## Example\n\n```python\n\"The turtle is leaving.\" ==> 3.67\n```\n\nThe average number of words per sentence is `4` and the average number of syllables per word is `1.5`. The score is then `(0.39 * 4) +  (11.8 * 1.5) - 15.59` = `3.67`\n",

Thus the bit positions label the powers of minus two, as seen in the following five-bit tables:\n\n    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    |  Bits  |  Value  |  Bits  |  Value  |  Bits  |  Value  |  Bits  |  Value  |\n    | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- |\n    | 00000  |    0    | 01000  |    -8   | 10000  |    16   | 11000  |    8    |\n    | 00001  |    1    | 01001  |    -7   | 10001  |    17   | 11001  |    9    |\n    | 00010  |   -2    | 01010  |   -10   | 10010  |    14   | 11010  |    6    |\n    | 00011  |   -1    | 01011  |    -9   | 10011  |    15   | 11011  |    7    |\n    | 00100  |    4    | 01100  |    -4   | 10100  |    20   | 11100  |    12   |\n    | 00101  |    5    | 01101  |    -3   | 10101  |    21   | 11101  |    13   |\n    | 00110  |    2    | 01110  |    -6   | 10110  |    18   | 11110  |    10   |\n    | 00111  |    3    | 01111  |    -5   | 10111  |    19   | 11111  |    11   |\n    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    |  Bits  |  Value  |  Bits  |  Value  |  Bits  |  Value  |  Bits  |  Value  |\n    | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- |\n    | 01010  |   -10   | 00010  |    -2   | 11010  |    6    | 10010  |    14   |\n    | 01011  |    -9   | 00011  |    -1   | 11011  |    7    | 10011  |    15   |\n    | 01000  |    -8   | 00000  |    0    | 11000  |    8    | 10000  |    16   |\n    | 01001  |    -7   | 00001  |    1    | 11001  |    9    | 10001  |    17   |\n    | 01110  |    -6   | 00110  |    2    | 11110  |    10   | 10110  |    18   |\n    | 01111  |    -5   | 00111  |    3    | 11111  |    11   | 10111  |    19   |\n    | 01100  |    -4   | 00100  |    4    | 11100  |    12   | 10100  |    20   |\n    | 01101  |    -3   | 00101  |    5    | 11101  |    13   | 10101  |    21   |\n    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\nNumbers are presented on the screen in Weird Binary, and then numbers are accepted in response from the console as a stream of zeroes and ones, terminated by a five-second pause.  You are writing a computer program to support the novice geek in playing the game by translating numbers between decimal and Weird Binary.\n\n#Input\n\nThe `skrzat` function will either convert into Weird Binary or out of Weird Binary: The first parameter will be either the letter `\"b\"`, which indicates that the second parameter is written in Weird Binary and needs to be converted to decimal; the letter `\"d\"` indicates that the second parameter is a decimal and needs to be converted to Weird Binary.

Some good places to start are: the [MDN pages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), and [Regular-Expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/).\n\nYou are to write a Regular Expression that matches any string with at least one number divisible by 4 (with no remainder). In most languages, you could do this easily by using `number % 4 == 0`. How would you do it with Regex?\n\nA number will start with `[` and end with `]`. They may (or may not) include a plus or minus symbol at the start; this should be taken into account. Leading zeros may be present, and should be ignored (no octals here ;P). There may be other text in the string, outside of the number; this should also be ignored. Also, all numbers will be integers; any floats should be ignored.\n\nIf there are no valid numbers defined as above, there should be no match made by your regex.\n\nSo here are some examples:\n```\n\"[+05620]\" // 5620 is divisible by 4 (valid)\n\"[+05621]\" // 5621 is not divisible by 4 (invalid)\n\"[-55622]\" // -55622 is not divisible by 4 (invalid)\n\"[005623]\" // 5623 invalid\n\"[005624]\" // 5624 valid\n\"[-05628]\" // valid\n\"[005632]\" // valid\n\"[555636]\" // valid\n\"[+05640]\" // valid\n\"[005600]\" // valid\n\"the beginning [0] ...

        "description": "Each element in the periodic table has a symbol associated with it. For instance, the symbol for the element Yttrium is `Y`. A fun thing to do is see if we can form words using symbols of elements strung together. The symbol for Einsteinium is `Es`, so the symbols for Yttrium and Einsteinium together form:\n\n`Y + Es = YEs`\n\nYes! Ignoring capitalization, we can think of any string of letters formed by the concatenation of one or more element symbols as an *elemental word* -- per the above,`yes` is an elemental word. There is only one combination of element symbols that can form `yes`, but in general, there may be more than one combination of element symbols that can form a given elemental word. Let's call each different combination of element symbols that can form a given elemental word `word` an *elemental form* of `word`.\n\nYour task is to implement the function `elementalForms(word)`, which takes one parameter (the string `word`), and returns an array (which we'll call `forms`). If `word` can be formed by combining element symbols from the periodic table, then `forms` should contain one or more sub-arrays, each consisting of strings of the form `'elementName (elementSymbol)'`, *for each unique combination of elements that can form* `word`.\n\n### Example\n\nThe word `'snack'` can be formed by concatenating the symbols of 3 different combinations of elements:\n\n```\n----------------------------------------------------\n|       1        |       2        |       3        |\n|---------------------------------------------------\n| Sulfur    (S)  | Sulfur    (S)  | Tin       (Sn) |\n| Nitrogen  (N)  | Sodium    (Na) | Actinium  (Ac) |\n| Actinium  (Ac) | Carbon    (C)  | Potassium (K)  |\n| Potassium (K)  | Potassium (K)  |                |\n----------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nSo `elementalForms('snack')` should return the following array:\n\n```javascript\n[\n  ['Sulfur (S)', 'Nitrogen (N)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Potassium (K)'],\n  ['Sulfur (S)', 'Sodium (Na)', 'Carbon (C)', 'Potassium (K)'],\n  ['Tin (Sn)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Potassium (K)']\n]\n```\n\n```python\n[\n  ['Sulfur (S)', 'Nitrogen (N)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Potassium (K)'],\n  ['Sulfur (S)', 'Sodium (Na)', 'Carbon (C)', 'Potassium (K)'],\n  ['Tin (Sn)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Potassium (K)']\n]\n```\n\n```csharp\n{\n  {\"Sulfur (S)\", \"Nitrogen (N)\", \"Actinium (Ac)\", \"Potassium (K)\"},\n  {\"Sulfur (S)\", \"Sodium (Na)\", \"Carbon (C)\", \"Potassium (K)\"},\n  {\"Tin (Sn)\", \"Actinium (Ac)\", \"Potassium (K)\"}\n}\n```\n\n```rust\nvec![\n  vec!['Sulfur (S)', 'Nitrogen (N)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Potassium (K)'],\n  vec!['Sulfur (S)', 'Sodium (Na)', 'Carbon (C)', 'Potassium (K)'],\n  vec!['Tin (Sn)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Potassium (K)']\n]\n```\n\n### Guidelines\n\n- Symbols can have length `1`, `2` or `3` (this kata uses pre-2016 temporary symbols for elements 113, 115, 117 and 118).\n- Capitalization does not matter:\n\n```javascript\nelementalForms('beach')\n// => [ ['Beryllium (Be)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Hydrogen (H)'] ]\nelementalForms('BEACH')\n// => [ ['Beryllium (Be)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Hydrogen (H)'] ]\n```\n\n```python\nelemental_forms('beach')\n// => [ ['Beryllium (Be)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Hydrogen (H)'] ]\nelemental_forms('BEACH')\n// => [ ['Beryllium (Be)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Hydrogen (H)'] ]\n```\n\n```csharp\nElementalForms(\"beach\")\n// { {\"Beryllium (Be)\", \"Actinium (Ac)\", \"Hydrogen (H)\"} }\nElementalForms(\"BEACH\")\n// { {\"Beryllium (Be)\", \"Actinium (Ac)\", \"Hydrogen (H)\"} }\n```\n\n```rust\nelemental_forms('beach')\n// => vec![ vec!['Beryllium (Be)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Hydrogen (H)'] ]\nelemental_forms('BEACH')\n// => vec![ vec!['Beryllium (Be)', 'Actinium (Ac)', 'Hydrogen (H)'] ]\n```\n\n- The order of the returned sub-arrays does not matter, but the order of the strings within each sub-array *does* matter -- they should be in the order that \"spells out\" `word`.\n- If `word` is not an elemental word (that is, no combination of **one or more** element symbols can form `word`), return an empty array.\n- You do not need to check the type of `word`. It will always be a (possibly empty) string.\n\n```if:javascript\nFinally, the helper object `ELEMENTS` has been provided, which is a map from each element symbol to its corresponding full name (e.g. `ELEMENTS['Na'] === 'Sodium'`).\n```\n\n```if:python\nFinally, a dict `ELEMENTS` has been preloaded and is accessible from your code, which is a map from each element symbol to its corresponding full name (e.g. `ELEMENTS['Na'] == 'Sodium'`).\n```\n\n```if:csharp\nFinally, a dictionary `ELEMENTS` has been preloaded and is accessible from your code, which is a mapping from each element symbol to its corresponding full name (e.g. `ELEMENTS[\"Na\"] == \"Sodium\"`).\n```\n\n```if:rust\nFinally, a hashmap `ELEMENTS` has been preloaded and is accessible from your code, which is a `HashMap<&str, &str>` from each element symbol to its corresponding full name (e.g. `ELEMENTS[\"Na\"] == \"Sodium\"`).\n```\n\nHave fun!",

        "description": "For a new 3D game that will be released, a team of programmers needs an easy function. (Then it will be processed as a method in a Class, forget this concept for Ruby)\n\nWe have an sphere with center <b>O</b>, having in the space the coordinates `[\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3]` and radius `r`  and a list of points, `points_list`, each one with coordinates `[x, y, z]`. Select the biggest triangle (or triangles) that has (have) all its (their) 3 vertice(s) as interior points of the sphere (not even in the sphere contour). You should consider that a point P is interior if its distance to center O, d, is such that:\n\n<code>\nd < r\n</code>\n<span style=\"margin: 0 5px 0 10px\">and </span>\n<code>\n|(d - r) / r| > 10<sup>-10</sup>\n</code>\n\nLet's see the situation with the following points in the image posted below:\n```python\nA = [1,2,-4]; B = [-3, 2, 4]; C = [7, 8, -4]; D = [2, 3, 5]; E = [-2, -1, 1]\n```\n\nThe sphere has the following features:\n```\nO = [1, 2, -2] (Center of the sphere)\nradius = 8\n```\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/dtZGfIN\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dtZGfIN.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nAs C is the only exterior point of the sphere, the possible triangles that have their vertices interior to the sphere are: \n\n```\nABD, ABE, ADE, BDE\n```\n\nLet's see which is the biggest one:\n\n```python\nTriangle    Triangle with its points         Area\nABD        [[1,2,-4],[-3,2,4],[2,3,5]]    22.44994432064\nABE        [[1,2,-4],[-3,2,4],[-2,-1,1]]  13.56465996625\nADE        [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]   22.62741699796 <---- biggest triangle\nBDE        [[-3,2,4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]   11.31370849898\n```\n\n\n\n~~~if:javascript\nOur function `biggestTriangInt()` should output for this case:\n\n```javascript\npointsList = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1]]\ncenter = [1, 2, -2]\nradius = 8\nbiggestTriangInt(pointsList, center, radius) == [4, 22.62741699796,  [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]]\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if-not:javascript\nOur function `biggest_triang_int()` should output for this case:\n\n```python\npoints_list = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1]]\ncenter = [1, 2, -2]\nradius = 8\nbiggest_triang_int(points_list, center, radius) == [4, 22.62741699796,  [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]]\n```\n~~~\n\n\nThat means that with the given points list we may generate 4 triangles with all their vertices as interior points of the sphere, the biggest triangle has an area of 22.62741699796 (the units does not matter and the values for the area should not be rounded) and finally, there is only one triangle with this maximum value.\nEvery triangle should be output having the same order of its vertices than in the given list of points. B = [-3,2,4], comes before than D =[2,3,5] and the last one E = [-2,-1,1]\nIf in the result we have only one triangle, the function should output a list of three points.\n\nLet'see the next case:\n\n```python\npoints_list = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1],\n              [3, 2, 6], [1, 4, 0], [-4, -5, -6], [4, 5, 6], [-2, -3, -5],\n              [-1, -2, 4], [-3, -2, -6], [-1, -4, 0], [2, 1, -1]]\nsphere_center = [0, 0, 0]\nradius = 8\nbiggest_triang_int(points_list, sphere_center, radius) == [165, 33.645207682521445, [[[1, 2, -4], [3, 2, 6], [-1, -4, 0]], [[1, 4, 0], [-1, -2, 4], [-3, -2, -6]]]]\n```\n\nNow there are a total of 165 triangles with their vertices in the sphere, the biggest triangle has an area of 33.645207682521445 but we have two triangles with this area value. The vertices of each triangle respect the order of the points list as we expressed before but the additional detail is that the triangles are sorted by the values of the coordinates of their points. Let's compare the coordinates of the first point\n\n```\nFirst point   x  y  z\nTriangle1     1  2 -4  <--- this triangle is first in the result\nTriangle2     1  4  0\n              |  |\n              |  y1 < y2 (2, 4)\n              |\n              x1 = x2     (1 = 1)\n```\n\nIn the case that all the given points are exterior to the sphere the function should output the empty list.\n\nThe points in the list are all valid and each one occurs once.\n\nRemember that if three points are collinear do not form a triangle. For practical purposes you may consider that if the area of a triangle is lower than 10<sup>-8</sup>, the points are aligned.\n\nEnjoy it!\n\n",

        "description": "Magic The Gathering is a collectible card game that features wizards battling against each other with spells and creature summons. The game itself can be quite complicated to learn. In this series of katas, we'll be solving some of the situations that arise during gameplay. You won't need any prior knowledge of the game to solve these contrived problems, as I will provide you with enough information.\n\n## Creatures\n\nEach creature has a power and toughness. We will represent this in an array. [2, 3] means this creature has a power of 2 and a toughness of 3.\n\nWhen two creatures square off, they each deal damage equal to their power to each other at the same time. This only happens once. If a creature takes on damage greater than or equal to their toughness, they die.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Creature 1 - [2, 3]\n- Creature 2 - [3, 3]\n- Creature 3 - [1, 4]\n- Creature 4 - [4, 1]\n\nIf creature 1 battles creature 2, creature 1 dies, while 2 survives. If creature 3 battles creature 4, they both die, as 3 deals 1 damage to 4, but creature 4 only has a toughness of 1.\n\nWrite a function `battle(player1, player2)` that takes in 2 arrays of creatures. Each players' creatures battle each other in order (player1[0] battles the creature in player2[0]) and so on. If one list of creatures is longer than the other, those creatures are considered unblocked, and do not battle.\n\nYour function should return an object (a hash in Ruby) with the keys player1 and player2 that contain the power and toughness of the surviving creatures.\n\nExample:\n````javascript\nplayer1 = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [5, 5]];\nplayer2 = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [3, 3]];\nbattle(player1, player2) ->\n{ 'player1': [[5, 5]],\n  'player2': [[1, 2], [3, 3]] }\n````\n````coffeescript\nplayer1 = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [5, 5]]\nplayer2 = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [3, 3]]\nbattle(player1, player2) # { 'player1': [[5, 5]], 'player2': [[1, 2], [3, 3]] }\n````\n````ruby\nplayer1 = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [5, 5]];\nplayer2 = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [3, 3]];\nbattle(player1, player2) # { player1: [[5, 5]], player2: [[1, 2], [3, 3]] }\n````\n\nGood luck with your battles!\n\n<div style=\"width: 320px; text-align: center; color: white; border: white 1px solid;\">\nCheck out my other Magic The Gathering katas:\n</div>\n<div>\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/magic-the-gathering-number-1-creatures'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>Magic The Gathering #1:</span> Creatures</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/magic-the-gathering-number-2-mana'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>Magic The Gathering #2:</span> Mana</a><br />\n\n</div>\n",

        "description": "The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous one. Take any positive integer n, if it is even divide it by 2, if it is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1 and continue indefinitely.The conjecture is that whatever is n the sequence will reach 1. There is many ways to approach this problem, each one of them had given beautifull graphs and impressive display of calculation power. The simplest approach can be found in this kata: http://www.codewars.com/kata/5286b2e162056fd0cb000c20\nYou look at the Collatz sequence of a number and see when it reaches 1.\n\nIn this kata we will take a look at the length of collatz sequences. And how they evolve. Write a function that take a positive integer n and return the number between 1 and n that has the maximum Collatz sequence length and the maximum length. The output has to take the form of an array [number, maxLength] For exemple the Collatz sequence of 4 is [4,2,1], 3 is [3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1], 2 is [2,1], 1 is [1], so `MaxCollatzLength(4)` should return `[3,8]`. If n is not a positive integer, the function have to return [].\n\n* As you can see, numbers in Collatz sequences may exceed n.\n\nThe last tests use random big numbers so you may consider some optimisation in your code:\n\n* You may get very unlucky and get only hard numbers: try submitting 2-3 times if it times out; if it still does, probably you need to optimize your code more;\n\n* Optimisation 1: when calculating the length of a sequence, if n is odd, what 3n+1 will be ?\n\n* Optimisation 2: when looping through 1 to n, take i such that i<n/2, what will be the lenght of the sequence for 2i ?",

        "description": "Many websites use weighted averages of various polls to make projections for elections. They\u2019re weighted based on a variety of factors, such as historical accuracy of the polling firm, sample size, as well as date(s). The weights, in this kata, are already calculated for you. All you need to do is convert a set of polls with weights, into a fixed projection for the result.\n\n#### Task:\n\nYour job is to convert an array of candidates (variable name `candidates`) and an array of polls (variable name `polls`), each poll with two parts, a result and a weight, into a guess of the result, with each value rounded to one decimal place, through use of a weighted average. Weights can be zero! Don't worry about the sum not totalling 100. The final result should be a hash in Ruby and Crystal, dictionary in Python, or object in JS in the format shown below:\n\n```ruby\n{ \n  \"<candidate name 1>\" => \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  \"<candidate name 2>\" => \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n```crystal\n{} of (String | Char) => Float64\n{ \n  \"<candidate name 1>\" => \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  \"<candidate name 2>\" => \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n```python\n{ \n  \"<candidate name 1>\": \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  \"<candidate name 2>\": \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  ...\n}\n\nFor your convenience, a function named round1 has been defined for you. You can\nuse it to round to the nearest tenth correctly (due to the inaccuracy of round\nand floats in general).\n```\n```javascript\n{ \n  \"<candidate name 1>\": \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  \"<candidate name 2>\": \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n```coffeescript\n{ \n  \"<candidate name 1>\": \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  \"<candidate name 2>\": \"<candidate's projected percent, rounded to nearest tenth>\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n_The input should not be modified._\n\n####

So you are responsible for purchasing raw materials needed to produce the robots.\n\nA complete robot weights `50` kilogram. Iron is the only material needed to create a robot. All iron is inserted in the first machine; the output of this machine is the input for the next one, and so on. The whole process is sequential. Unfortunately not all machines are first class, so a given percentage of their inputs are destroyed during processing.\n\n# Task\n\nYou need to figure out how many kilograms of iron you need to buy to build the requested number of robots.\n\n# Example\n\nThree machines are used to create a robot. Each of them produces `10%` scrap. Your target is to deliver `90` robots.  \nThe method will be called with the following parameters:\n\n```\nCalculateScrap(scrapOfTheUsedMachines, numberOfRobotsToProduce)\nCalculateScrap(int[] { 10, 10, 10 }, 90)\n```\n\n# Assumptions\n\n* The scrap is less than `100%`.\n* The scrap is never negative.\n* There is at least one machine in the manufacturing line.\n* Except for scrap there is no material lost during manufacturing.\n* The number of produced robots is always a positive number.\n* You can only buy full kilograms of iron.",

Players are ranked according to an internal scoring system that players don't see.\n\nYou've discovered the formula for the scoring system!\n\nCreate a function called `scoring()` that takes an array of Player objects and returns an array of player names, in order of descending score (highest score is index 0, 2nd highest is index 1, etc.).\n\nEach player's score is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Each normal kill is worth 100 points\n2. Each assist is worth 50 points\n3. Each point of damage done is worth 0.5 points\n4. Each point of healing done is worth 1 point\n5. The longest kill streak is worth 2^N, where N is the number of kills of the streak\n6. Environmental kills are worth 500 points (These are counted separately from normal kills)\n\nFor each of the above statistic, a Player object contains a respective \"key:value\" pairing. All values except the 'name' are integers.\n\n```javascript\nvar player1 = {\n  name: \"JuanPablo\",\n  normKill: 5,\n  assist: 12,\n  damage: 3200,\n  healing: 0,\n  streak: 4,\n  envKill: 1\n}\nvar player2 = {\n  name: \"ProfX\",\n  normKill: 2,\n  assist: 14,\n  damage: 600,\n  healing: 1500,\n  streak: 0,\n  envKill: 0\n}\nscoring([player1, player2]); \n//[\"JuanPable\",\"ProfX\"]\n// Scores of 3216 and 2701, respectively.\n```\nNote:  \nAssume the input array will ALWAYS have a properly constructed Player object (no missing keys or values)  \nNames will not contain unusual characters nor repeat (names are unique)  \nPlayers with the same score should be sorted by the order they appear in the array  \nFor simplicity, for a kill streak of 0 the kill streak calculation will yield 1 (or 2<sup>0</sup>) points",

That idea is related with the purpose of this kata: we should select all the primes that when reversed are a **different** prime (so palindromic primes should be discarded).\n\nFor example: 13, 17 are prime numbers and the reversed respectively are 31, 71 which are also primes, so 13 and 17 are \"emirps\".\nBut primes 757, 787, 797 are palindromic primes, meaning that the reversed number is the same as the original, so they are not considered as \"emirps\" and should be discarded.\n\nThe emirps sequence is registered in OEIS as [A006567](https://oeis.org/A006567)\n\n\n## Your task\n\nCreate a function that receives one argument `n`, as an upper limit, and the return the following array:\n\n`[number_of_emirps_below_n, largest_emirp_below_n, sum_of_emirps_below_n]`\n\n\n## Examples\n```python\nfind_emirp(10)\n[0, 0, 0] ''' no emirps below 10 '''\n\nfind_emirp(50)\n[4, 37, 98] ''' there are 4 emirps below 50: 13, 17, 31, 37; largest = 37; sum = 98 '''\n\nfind_emirp(100)\n[8, 97, 418] ''' there are 8 emirps below 100: 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97; largest = 97; sum = 418 '''\n```\n\nHappy coding!!\n\nAdvise: Do not use a primality test. It will make your code very slow. Create a set of primes using a prime generator or a range of primes producer. Remember that search in a set is faster that in a sorted list or array\n\n",

The robot labels each card in the format `TXY` where `T` is the suit and `XY` is the number. If the card\u2019s number consists of one digit, then X = 0. For example, the card of suit `\"P\"` and number `9` is labelled `\"P09\"`.\n\n A complete deck has `52` cards in total. For each of the four suits there is exactly one card with a number between `1` and `13`.\n\n The robot has read the labels of all the cards in the deck and combined them into the string `s`.\n \n Your task is to help Pero finish the robot by writing a program that reads the string made out of card labels and returns the number of cards that are missing for each suit.\n\n If there are two same cards in the deck, return array with `[-1, -1, -1, -1]` instead.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `s`\n\n  A correct string of card labels. 0 \u2264 |S| \u2264 1000\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer array\n\n  Array of four elements, representing the number of missing card of suits `\"P\", \"K\", \"H\", and \"T\"` respectively.

        "description": "## Background - the Collatz Conjecture:\n\nImagine you are given a positive integer, `n`, then:\n\n* if `n` is even, calculate: `n / 2`\n* if `n` is odd, calculate: `3 * n + 1`\n\nRepeat until your answer is `1`. The Collatz conjecture states that performing this operation repeatedly, you will always eventually reach `1`.\n\nYou can try creating Collatz sequences with [this](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5286b2e162056fd0cb000c20) kata. For further information, see the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).\n\n## Now! Your task:\n\n**Given an array of positive integers, return the integer whose Collatz sequence is the longest.**\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nlongestCollatz([2, 4, 3])===3;\n```\n```python\nlongest_collatz([2, 4, 3])==3\n```\n```ruby\nlongest_collatz([2, 4, 3])==3\n```\n\nExplanation: The Collatz sequence for `2` has a length of `1`, the sequence for `4` has a length of `2`, and the sequence for `3` has a length of `7`. So from our array, the integer `3` is the one with the longest Collatz sequence.\n\nHence, your function should return `3`.\n\n\n## Note:\n\nThere may be more than one answer, i.e. two or more integers produce the longest Collatz sequence, because they happen to have sequences of the same length. **In this case, your function should return the integer that appears first in the array.**\n\nExample:\nGiven an array: `[2, 5, 32]`, both `5` and `32` have Collatz sequences of length 5. These are also the longest sequences from our array.\n\nIn this case, our function returns `5`, because `5` comes before `32` in our array.\n\n",

However, sometimes, if they are far enough away from each other, especially on a warm day when all they really want to do is pick a spot in the sun and lie in it, they will ignore each other, and once again there will be a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Peaceable+Kingdom&source=lnms&tbm=isch\">Peaceable Kingdom</a>.\n\n## Your Mission\nIn this, the first and simplest of a planned trilogy of cat katas :-), all you have to do is determine whether the distances between any visiting cats are large enough to make for a peaceful afternoon, or whether there is about to be an altercation someone will need to deal with by carrying one of them into the house or squirting them with water or what have you.\n\nAs input your function will receive a list of strings representing the yard as a grid, and an integer representing the minimum distance needed to prevent problems (considering the cats' current states of sleepiness). A point with no cat in it will be represented by a \"-\" dash. Lou, Mustache Cat, and Raoul will be represented by an upper case L, M, and R respectively. At any particular time all three cats may be in the yard, or maybe two, one, or even none. \n\nIf the number of cats in the yard is one or none, or if the distances between all cats are at least the minimum distance, your function should return True/true/TRUE (depending on what language you're using), but if there are two or three cats, and the distance between at least two of them is smaller than the minimum distance, your function should return False/false/FALSE.\n\n## Some examples\n(The yard will be larger in the random test cases, but a smaller yard is easier to see and fit into the instructions here.)\n\nIn this first example, there is only one cat, so your function should return True.\n```\n[\"------------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"-L----------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"------------\"], 10\n```\nIn this second example, Mustache Cat is at the point yard[1][3] and Raoul is at the point yard[4][7] -- a distance of 5, so because the distance between these two points is smaller than the specified minimum distance of 6, there will be trouble, and your function should return False. \n```\n[\"------------\",\n \"---M--------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"-------R----\",\n \"------------\"], 6\n```\nIn this third example, Lou is at yard[0][11], Raoul is at yard[1][2], and Mustache Cat at yard[5][2]. The distance between Lou and Raoul is 9.05538513814, the distance between Raoul and Mustache Cat is 4, and the distance between Mustache Cat and Lou is 10.295630141 -- all greater than or equal to the specified minimum distance of 4, so the three cats will nap peacefully, and your function should return True.\n```\n[\"-----------L\",\n \"--R---------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"------------\",\n \"--M---------\"], 4\n```\nHave fun!\n",

Your job is to approximate the integral of that function on the closed interval [a,b] with n rectangles. You will use the left hand rule. For a better explanation of the assigment visit the wikipedia page on riemann sums linked below:\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum*\n\n- f will always take a single float argument \n- f will always be a \"nice\" function, don't worry about NaN\n- n will always be a natural number (0, N] \n- b > a \n- and n will be chosen appropriately given the length of [a, b] (as in I will not have step sizes smaller than machine epsilon)\n",

More information can be found in the [MongoDB documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/object-id/) (which you have to read in order to implement this Kata).\n\nSo let us implement the following helper which will have 2 methods:\n - one which verifies that the string is a valid Mongo ID string, and\n - one which finds the timestamp from a MongoID string\n\n*Note:*\n\nIf you take a close look at a Codewars URL, you will notice each kata's id (the `XXX` in `http://www.codewars.com/dojo/katas/XXX/train/javascript`) is really similar to MongoDB's ids, which brings us to the conjecture that this is the database powering Codewars.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThe verification method will return `true` if an element provided is a valid Mongo string and `false` otherwise:\n\n```javascript\nMongo.isValid('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')  // true\nMongo.isValid('507f1f77bcf86cz799439011')  // false\nMongo.isValid('507f1f77bcf86cd79943901')   // false\nMongo.isValid('111111111111111111111111')  // true\nMongo.isValid(111111111111111111111111)    // false\nMongo.isValid('507f1f77bcf86cD799439011')  // false (we arbitrarily only allow lowercase letters)\n```\n```python\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')  # True\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cz799439011')  # False\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cd79943901')   # False\nMongo.is_valid('111111111111111111111111')  # True\nMongo.is_valid(111111111111111111111111)    # False\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cD799439011')  # False (we arbitrarily only allow lowercase letters)\n```\n```ruby\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')  # true\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cz799439011')  # false\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cd79943901')   # false\nMongo.is_valid('111111111111111111111111')  # true\nMongo.is_valid(111111111111111111111111)    # false\nMongo.is_valid('507f1f77bcf86cD799439011')  # false (we arbitrarily only allow lowercase letters)\n```\n\nThe timestamp method will return a date/time object from the timestamp of the Mongo string and false otherwise:\n\n```javascript\n// Mongo.getTimestamp should return a Date object\n\nMongo.getTimestamp('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')  // Wed Oct 17 2012 21:13:27 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\nMongo.getTimestamp('507f1f77bcf86cz799439011')  // false\nMongo.getTimestamp('507f1f77bcf86cd79943901')   // false\nMongo.getTimestamp('111111111111111111111111')  // Sun Jan 28 1979 00:25:53 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\nMongo.getTimestamp(111111111111111111111111)    // false\n```\n```python\n# Mongo.get_timestamp should return a datetime object\n\nMongo.get_timestamp('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')  # Wed Oct 17 2012 21:13:27 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\nMongo.get_timestamp('507f1f77bcf86cz799439011')  # False\nMongo.get_timestamp('507f1f77bcf86cd79943901')   # False\nMongo.get_timestamp('111111111111111111111111')  # Sun Jan 28 1979 00:25:53 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\nMongo.get_timestamp(111111111111111111111111)    # False\n```\n```ruby\n# Mongo.get_timestamp should return a datetime object\n\nMongo.get_timestamp('507f1f77bcf86cd799439011')  # Wed Oct 17 2012 21:13:27 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\nMongo.get_timestamp('507f1f77bcf86cz799439011')  # false\nMongo.get_timestamp('507f1f77bcf86cd79943901')   # false\nMongo.get_timestamp('111111111111111111111111')  # Sun Jan 28 1979 00:25:53 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\nMongo.get_timestamp(111111111111111111111111)    # false\n```\n\nWhen you will implement this correctly, you will not only get some points, but also would be able to check creation time of all the kata here :-)",

In the process of investigating the land, he learned that the state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year, due to erosion caused by the Mississippi River. Since Fred is hoping to live in this house the rest of his life, he needs to know if his land is going to be lost to erosion.\n\n After doing more research, Fred has learned that the land that is being lost forms a semicircle. This semicircle is part of a circle centered at (0,0), with the line that bisects the circle being the `x` axis. Locations below the `x` axis are in the water. The semicircle has an area of 0 at the beginning of year 1. (Semicircle illustrated in the Figure.)\n\n ![](https://i.ibb.co/tYhJSKw/semicircle.gif)\n \n Given two coordinates `x` and `y`, your task is to calculate that Fred Mapper's house will begin eroding in how many years.\n \n Note:\n\n 1. No property will appear exactly on the semicircle boundary: it will either be inside or outside. \n\n 2. All locations are given in miles.\n \n 3.

Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.\n\nThe result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced.

        "description": "Clients place orders to a stockbroker as strings. The order can be simple or multiple or empty.\n  \n  Type of a simple order: Quote/white-space/Quantity/white-space/Price/white-space/Status\n  \n  where Quote is formed of non-whitespace character, \n  Quantity is an int, \n  Price a double (with mandatory decimal point \".\" ), \n  Status is represented by the letter B (buy) or the letter S (sell).\n  \n#### Example: \n  \n  `\"GOOG 300 542.0 B\"`\n  \n  A multiple order is the concatenation of simple orders with a comma between each.\n  \n#### Example: \n  \n  `\"ZNGA 1300 2.66 B, CLH15.NYM 50 56.32 B, OWW 1000 11.623 B, OGG 20 580.1 B\"`\n  \n  or\n  \n  `\"ZNGA 1300 2.66 B,CLH15.NYM 50 56.32 B,OWW 1000 11.623 B,OGG 20 580.1 B\"`\n  \n  To ease the stockbroker your task is to produce a string of type\n  \n`\"Buy: b Sell: s\"`\n  where b and s are 'double' \n  formatted with no decimal, b representing the total price of bought stocks and s the total price of sold stocks.\n  \n#### Example: \n  \n  `\"Buy: 294990 Sell: 0\"`\n  \n  Unfortunately sometimes clients make mistakes. When you find mistakes in orders, you must pinpoint these badly formed orders\n  and produce a string of type:\n  \n  `\"Buy: b Sell: s; Badly formed nb: badly-formed 1st simple order ;badly-formed nth simple order ;\"`\n  \n  where nb is the number of badly formed simple orders, b representing the total price of bought stocks\n  with correct simple order and s the total price of sold stocks with correct simple order.\n  \n#### Examples: \n  \n  `\"Buy: 263 Sell: 11802; Badly formed 2: CLH16.NYM 50 56 S ;OWW 1000 11 S ;\"`\n  \n  `\"Buy: 100 Sell: 56041; Badly formed 1: ZNGA 1300 2.66 ;\"`\n  \n#### Notes:\n  - If the order is empty, Buy is 0 and Sell is 0 hence the return is: \"Buy: 0 Sell: 0\".\n  - Due to Codewars whitespace differences will not always show up in test results.\n  - With Golang (and maybe others) you can use a format with \"%.0f\" for \"Buy\" and \"Sell\".",

        "description": "Write a program that performs a search for solutions to a word game.  The goal of the game is to find sets of five words that share a vowel alternation.  E.g., one solution to the game might be the words:\n\n    ['last', 'lest', 'list', 'lost', 'lust']\n\nThis list above is a valid solution instance since the vowels `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'` occur in the same positions between the consonant clusters `'l'` and `'st'`.\n\nYour program should return a list of all solutions (like the list above) given a list of words to search through.\n\nNote that **order matters**.  If you prefer to use sets for book-keeping purposes, that is fine, but you will need to sort your list of solutions, and each solution set itself.\n\nThis is easy in Python:\n\n    solutions = [set(['last', 'lest', 'list', 'lost', 'lust']),\n                 set(['bill', 'bull', 'bell', 'ball', 'boll'])]\n    \n    sorted_soultions = sorted(sorted(solution) for solution in solutions)\n    sorted_solutions == [['ball', 'bell', 'bill', 'boll', 'bull'],\n                         ['last', 'lest', 'list', 'lost', 'lust']]\n    \nFor the sake of simplificiation, you may assume that the words in the list you are searching over are unique.",

After that the players will try to find which cup contains the ball.\n\nYour task is as follows.  Given the cup that the ball starts under, and list of swaps, return the location of the ball at the end.  Cups are given like array/list indices.\n\nFor example, given the starting position `0` and the swaps `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 0)]`:\n\n * The first swap moves the ball from `0` to `1`\n * The second swap moves the ball from `1` to `2`\n * The final swap doesn't affect the position of the ball.\n \n So\n\n```haskell\nfindTheBall 0 [(0, 1), (2, 1), (0, 1)] == 2\n```\n```clojure\n(= (find-the-ball 0 [[0 1] [2 1] [0 1]]) 2)\n```\n```ruby\nswaps = [[0,1], [1,2], [1, 0]]\nfind_the_ball(0, swaps) == 2\n```\n```javascript\nswaps = [[0,1], [1,2], [1, 0]]\nfind_the_ball(0, swaps) == 2\n```\n```python\nfind_the_ball(0, [(0, 1), (2, 1), (0, 1)]) == 2\n```\n\nThere aren't necessarily only three cups in this game, but there will be at least two.

        "description": "DNA is a biomolecule that carries genetic information. It is composed of four different building blocks, called nucleotides: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). Two DNA strands join to form a double helix, whereby the nucleotides of one strand bond to the nucleotides of the other strand at the corresponding positions. The bonding is only possible if the nucleotides are complementary: A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G.\n\nDue to the asymmetry of the DNA, every DNA strand has a direction associated with it. The two strands of the double helix run in opposite directions to each other, which we refer to as the 'up-down' and the 'down-up' directions.\n\nWrite a function `checkDNA` that takes in two DNA sequences as strings, and checks if they are fit to form a fully complementary DNA double helix. The function should return a Boolean `true` if they are complementary, and `false` if there is a sequence mismatch (Example 1 below).\n\nNote:\n\n- All sequences will be of non-zero length, and consisting only of `A`, `T`, `C` and `G` characters.\n- All sequences **will be given in the up-down direction**.\n- The two sequences to be compared can be of different length. If this is the case and one strand is entirely bonded by the other, and there is no sequence mismatch between the two (Example 2 below), your function should still return `true`.\n- If both strands are only partially bonded (Example 3 below), the function should return `false`.\n\nExample 1:\n```javascript\nseq1 = 'GTCTTAGTGTAGCTATGCATGC';  // NB up-down\nseq2 = 'GCATGCATAGCTACACTACGAC';  // NB up-down\n\ncheckDNA (seq1, seq2);\n// --> false\n\n// Because there is a sequence mismatch at position 4:\n// (seq1)    up-GTCTTAGTGTAGCTATGCATGC-down\n//              ||| ||||||||||||||||||\n// (seq2)  down-CAGCATCACATCGATACGTACG-up\n```\n\nExample 2:\n\n```javascript\nseq1 = 'GCGCTGCTAGCTGATCGA';             // NB up-down\nseq2 = 'ACGTACGATCGATCAGCTAGCAGCGCTAC';  // NB up-down\n\ncheckDNA (seq1, seq2);\n// --> true\n\n// Because one strand is entirely bonded by the other:\n// (seq1)       up-GCGCTGCTAGCTGATCGA-down\n//                 ||||||||||||||||||\n// (seq2)  down-CATCGCGACGATCGACTAGCTAGCATGCA-up\n```\n\nExample 3:\n\n```javascript\nseq1 = 'CGATACGAACCCATAATCG';  // NB up-down\nseq2 = 'CTACACCGGCCGATTATGG';  // NB up-down\n\ncheckDNA (seq1, seq2);\n// --> false\n\n// Because both strands are only partially bonded:\n// (seq1)  up-CGATACGAACCCATAATCG-down\n//                      |||||||||\n// (seq2)          down-GGTATTAGCCGGCCACATC-up\n```\n\n---\n#### If you enjoyed this kata, check out also my other DNA kata: [**Longest Repeated DNA Motif**](http://www.codewars.com/kata/longest-repeated-dna-motif)\n",

To account for that:\n\n* if the last frame is a spare, player rolls 1 bonus ball.\n* if the last frame is a strike, player rolls 2 bonus balls.\n\nThese bonus balls on 10th frame are only counted as a bonus to the respective spare or strike.\n\n# More information\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring\n\n# Input\nYou may assume that the input is always valid.

        "description": "# Task\nCalculate a chess player's new Elo rating using their previous ratings (`experience`), their opponent's rating (`opponent`), the outcome of the new game (`score`), and the Factor k function (`k`).\n\n## Arguments\n* `experience` is an array/list containing the history of the player's ratings, with the last item in the array being the current rating. For example, if `experience` is `[995, 1025, 1050]`, then the player's 2 old ratings are 995 and 1025, and their current rating is 1050. If a player has no recorded experience (`experience = []`), use 1000 for their rating.\n* `opponent` is a single number indicating the opponent's rating\n* `score` is the outcome of the new game. `score` is `1` if the player won, `0` if the player lost, or `0.5` if it was a tie.\n* `k` is a function that takes in the `experience` array/list as an argument. `k` is an optional argument - sometimes a `k` function will be passed for you to use and sometimes not. You must write a default `k` function to use in case no `k` function is passed (see below for details).\n\n## Return\n\n* The `elo` function must return the new rating of the player rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n# Elo rating formula\n\nThe Elo rating system starts with an expectation formula:\n\n```\nexpectation = \n1 / (1+10^((opponent_rating - player_rating)/400))\n```\n\nThis can then be used in the new rating formula as follows:\n\n```\nnew_player_rating = \nplayer_rating + k(experience) * (score - expectation)\n```\n\nNote that `k` is a function taking in `experience` as a parameter.\n\n\n## Factor K function\n\nYou must write a default `k` function to use if no `k` function is passed to the `elo` function. The default `k` function should take in `experience` as an argument and return the following:\n\n* If player is a newbie (less than 30 games of experience), return 25.\n* If player is not a newbie, but player's rating has never reached 2400 before, return 15.\n* If player is not a newbie and has at least one record of a rating >= 2400, return 10.\n\n(These are pre-2011 FIDE rules.)\n\n\n# Examples\n* Example 1: `elo([], 1725, 1)` \n\nSince player has no experience, we will use 1000 as their rating. \n`opponent` rating is 1725.\n`score` is 1.\n\nThen we have:\n```\nexpectation\n= 1 / (1+10^((opponent_rating - player_rating)/400))\n= 1 / (1+10^((1725 - 1000)/400))\n= 0.01516572425000013\n```\nSince no `k` function was passed, we will use our default `k` function. Since player is a newbie (less than 30 games of experience), `k(experience)` will return 25.\n\nThen in our new_player_rating formula:\n```\nnew_player_rating\n= player_rating + k(experience) * (score - expectation)\n= 1000 + 25 * (1 - 0.01516572425000013)\n= 1024.62085689375\n```\nWhen we round this to the nearest integer our final answer is 1025.\n\n\n* Example 2:\n\n```\ndef k_algo(exp):\n    return 800//len(exp)\n    \nelo([1025, 1025, 1050, 1075, 1100, 1125, 1150,\n1175, 1200, 1225, 1250, 1275, 1300, 1325, 1350,\n1375, 1400, 1425, 1450, 1475, 1500, 1525, 1550,\n1575, 1600, 1625, 1650, 1675, 1700, 1725], \n1000,\n0, \nk_algo)\n```\n\nThe player's current rating is the last item in experience, 1725. \n`opponent` rating is 1000.\n`score` is 0.\nA function called `k_algo` is passed which we will use instead of our default `k` function.\n\nThen we have:\n```\nexpectation \n= 1 / (1+10^((opponent_rating - player_rating)/400))\n= 1 / (1+10^((1000 - 1725)/400))\n= 0.9848342757499998\n```\n\nWhen we pass `experience` to the `k_algo` function, we will get out `800//len(experience) = 26`.\n\n\nThen in our new_player_rating formula:\n```\nnew_player_rating \n= player_rating + k(experience) * (score - expectation)\n= 1725 + 26 * (0 - 0.9848342757499998)\n= 1699.3943088305\n```\nWhen we round this to the nearest integer our final answer is 1699.",

MiniBitMove has only two commands and operates on a array of bits. It works like this:\n\n- `1`: Flip the bit at the current cell\n- `0`: Move selector by 1\n\nIt takes two inputs, the program and the bits in needs to operate on. The program returns the modified bits. The program stops when selector reaches the end of the array. Otherwise the program repeats itself. **Note: This means that if a program does not have any zeros it is an infinite loop**\n\nExample of a program that flips all bits in an array:\n```\nCode: 10\nBits: 11001001001010\nResult: 00110110110101\n```\n\nAfter you're done, feel free to make translations and discuss this kata.",

Basic math rules do **NOT** apply, you have to do each computation in exactly this order.\n* This has to work for any size of numbers sent in (after division, go back to addition, etc).\n* In the case of duplicate alphabet letters, you have to arrange them according to the number that appeared first in the input string.\n* Remember to also round the final answer to the nearest integer.\n\n```\nExamples :\n\"24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b\" = 89 + 900 - 123 * 369 / 246 = 1299\n\"24z6 1z23 y369 89z 900b\" = 900 + 369 - 246 * 123 / 89 = 1414\n\"10a 90x 14b 78u 45a 7b 34y\" = 10 + 45 - 14 * 7 / 78 + 90 - 34 = 60\n``` \nGood luck and may the CODE be with you!\n",

The ant starts out on a grid of black and white cells and follows a simple set of rules that has complex emergent behavior.\n\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function and return the `n`th iteration of Langton's ant with the given input.\n\n\n### Parameters:\n\n* `grid` - a two dimensional array of `1`s and `0`s (representing white and black cells respectively)\n* `column` - horizontal position of ant\n* `row` - ant's vertical position\n* `n` - number of iterations\n* `dir` - ant's current direction (0 - north, 1 - east, 2 - south, 3 - west), **should default to 0**\n\n**Note:** parameters `column` and `row` will always be inside the `grid`, and number of generations `n` will never be negative.\n\n\n## Output\n\nThe state of the `grid` after `n` iterations.\n\n\n## Rules\n\nThe ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The ant moves according to the rules below:\n\n* At a white square (represented with `1`), turn 90\u00b0 right, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.\n* At a black square (`0`), turn 90\u00b0 left, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.\n\nThe grid has no limits and therefore if the ant moves outside the borders, the grid should be expanded with `0`s, respectively maintaining the rectangle shape.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```python\nant([[1]], 0, 0, 1, 0)   # should return: [[0, 0]]\n```\n```julia\nant([1; 1], 1, 1, 1, 0)   # should return: [0 0; 1 0]\n```\n\n\nInitially facing north (`0`), at the first iteration the ant turns right (because it stands on a white square, `1`), flips the square and moves forward.",

        "description": "You know combinations: for example, \nif you take `5` cards from a `52` cards deck you have `2,598,960` different combinations.\n\nIn mathematics the number of `x` combinations you can take from a set of `n` elements\nis called the *binomial coefficient of n and x*, or more often `n choose x`.\nThe formula to compute `n choose x` is:\n\n`n! / (x! * (n - x)!)`\n\nwhere `!` is the factorial operator.\n\nYou are a renowned poster designer and painter. You are asked to provide `6` posters \nall having the same design each in `2` colors. Posters must all have a different color combination and you have the choice of `4` colors: `red, blue, yellow, green`. \nHow many colors can you choose for each poster?\n\nThe answer is **two** since `4 choose 2 = 6`. The combinations will be:\n`{red, blue}, {red, yellow}, {red, green}, {blue, yellow}, {blue, green}, {yellow, green}`.\n\nNow same question but you have `35` posters to provide and `7` colors available. How many colors for each poster?\nIf you take combinations `7 choose 2` you will get `21` with the above formula.\nBut `21` schemes aren't enough for `35` posters. If you take `7 choose 5` combinations you will get `21` too.\nFortunately if you take `7 choose 3` or `7 choose 4` combinations you get `35` and so each poster will have a different combination of\n`3` colors or `4` colors. You will take `3` colors because it's less expensive.\n\n#### Hence the problem: \n\nKnowing `m` (number of posters to design) and `n` (total number of available colors), \nlet us search `x`, the number of colors for each poster so that each poster has a unique combination of colors and the number of combinations is exactly the same as the number of posters `m`.\n\nIn other words, you must find `x` such that:\n\n`n choose x = m` \n\nfor a given `m >= 0` and a given `n > 0`.\nIf there are several solutions, return the smallest. If there are no solutions, return `-1`.\n\n#### Examples:\n```\n(m =  6, n = 4) -->  2\n(m =  4, n = 4) -->  1\n(m =  4, n = 2) --> -1\n(m = 35, n = 7) -->  3\n(m = 36, n = 7) --> -1\n\na = 47129212243960\n(m = a,     n = 50) --> 20\n(m = a + 1, n = 50) --> -1\n```\n",

Given `distance` in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.  \n(If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)\n\nNote: Of course you can't do half a fold.

        "description": "In democracy we have a lot of elections. For example, we have to vote for a class representative in school, for a new parliament or a new government.\n\nUsually, we vote for a candidate, i.e. a set of eligible candidates is given. This is done by casting a ballot into a ballot-box. After that, it must be counted how many ballots (= votes) a candidate got. \n\nA candidate will win this election if he has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Majority_of_the_entire_membership\">absolute majority</a>.\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nReturn the name of the winner. If there is no winner, return `null / nil / None` depending on the language.\n\n\n## Task Description\n\nThere are no given candidates. An elector can vote for anyone. Each ballot contains only one name and represents one vote for this name. A name is an arbitrary string, e.g. `\"A\"`, `\"B\"`, or `\"XJDHD\"`. There are no spoiled ballots.\n\nThe ballot-box is represented by an unsorted list of names. Each entry in the list corresponds to one vote for this name. You do not know the names in advance (because there are no candidates).\n\nA name wins the election if it gets more than `n / 2` votes (`n` = number of all votes, i.e. the size of the given list). \n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n# 3 votes for \"A\", 2 votes for \"B\"  -->  \"A\" wins the election\n[\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\"]  -->  \"A\"\n\n# 2 votes for \"A\", 2 votes for \"B\"  -->  no winner\n[\"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\"]  -->  None / nil / null\n\n# 1 vote for each name --> no winner\n[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]  -->  None / nil / null\n\n# 3 votes for \"A\", 2 votes for \"B\", 1 vote for \"C\"  -->  no winner, as \"A\" does not have more than n / 2 = 3 votes\n[\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\"] -->  None / nil / null\n```\n\n\n## Note\n\nPlease keep in mind the list of votes can be large (`n <= 1 200 000`). The given list is immutable, i.e. you cannot modify the list (otherwise this could lead to vote rigging).\n\nGood luck and have fun.",

It has some credit you can use to buy things, but it may be used only for up to two items, and any credit you don't use is lost. You want something for a friend and yourself. Therefore, you want to buy two items which add up the entire gift card value.\n\n### Task\nYou will get the value of the gift card `c` and a finite list of item values. You should return a pair of indices that correspond to values that add up to `c`:\n\n```haskell\nbuy 2 [1,1]       = Just (0,1)\nbuy 3 [1,1]       = Nothing\nbuy 5 [5,2,3,4,5] = Just (1,2)\n```\n```javascript\nbuy(2,[1,1])       = [0,1]\nbuy(3,[1,1])       = null\nbuy(5,[5,2,3,4,5]) = [1,2]\n```\n```python\nbuy(2,[1,1])       = [0,1]\nbuy(3,[1,1])       = None\nbuy(5,[5,2,3,4,5]) = [1,2]\n```\n```coffeescript\nbuy 2, [1,1]       = [0,1]\nbuy 3, [1,1]       = null\nbuy 5, [5,2,3,4,5] = [1,2]\n```\n```cobol\n      buy 2, [1,1]       = [1, 2]\n      buy 3, [1,1]       = [0, 0]\n      buy 5, [5,2,3,4,5] = [2, 3]\n```\n    \nThe indices start at `0` (`1` in COBOL). The first index should always be smaller than the second index. If there are multiple solutions, return the minimum (lexicographically):\n\n```haskell\nbuy 5 [1,2,3,4,5] = Just (0,3) -- the values at (1,2) also adds up to five, but (0,3) < (1,2)\n```\n```javascript\nbuy(5,[1,2,3,4,5]) = [0,3] // the values at [1,2] also adds up to five, but [0,3] < [1,2]\n```\n```python\nbuy(5,[1,2,3,4,5]) = [0,3] # the values at [1,2] also adds up to five, but [0,3] < [1,2]\n```\n```coffeescript\nbuy 5, [1,2,3,4,5] = [0,3] # the values at [1,2] also adds up to five, but [0,3] < [1,2]\n```\n```cobol\n      buy 5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [1, 4]\n      * the values at [2, 3] also adds up to five, but [1, 4] < [2, 3]\n```\n",

        "description": "<h1>Tube strike options calculator</h1>\n<h3>The sweaty bus ride</h3>\nThere is a tube strike today so instead of getting the London Underground home you have decided to take the bus. It's a hot day and you have been sitting on the bus for over an hour, but the bus is hardly moving. Your arm is sticking to the window and sweat drips off your nose as you try to read your neighbour's book when you say to yourself, \"This is ridiculous. I could have walked faster than this!\" Suddenly you have an idea for an app that helps people decide whether to walk or take the bus home when the London Underground is on strike.\n\nYou rush home (relatively speaking) and begin to define the function that will underpin your app.\n\n<h3>Function specification</h3>\nYou must create a function which takes three parameters; walking distance home, distance the bus must travel, and the combined distance of walking from the office to the bus stop and from the bus stop to your house. All distances are in kilometres.\n\nSo for example, if your home is 5km away by foot, and the bus that takes you home travels 6km, but you have to walk 500 metres to the bus stop to catch it and 500 metres to your house once the bus arrives (i.e. 1km in total), which is faster, walking or taking the bus?\n\nExample - Which of these is faster?:\n<ul>\n<li>Start---Walk 5km--->End</li>\n\n<li>Start---Walk 500m---Bus 6km---Walk 500m--->End</li>\n</ul>\n\nWalking speed and bus driving speed have been given to you as two pre-loaded variables (```$global_variables``` in Ruby).\n\n```walk``` = 5 (km/hr)\n```bus``` = 8 (km/hr)\n\nThe function must return the fastest option, either \"Walk\" or \"Bus\". If the walk is going to be over 2 hours, the function should recommend that you take the bus. If the walk is going to be under 10 minutes, the function should recommend that you walk. If both options are going to take the same amount of time, the function should recommend that you walk\n",

The \nlength of a roll is `10` meters.\nHe bears in mind however, that it\u2019s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.\n\nLast time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? \n\n#### Task\nYour function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word\nin lower case the number of rolls he must buy.\n\n#### Example:\n\n`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"ten\"`\n\n`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"zero\"`\n\n#### Notes:\n\n- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge \n- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that `w * h * l` is zero\n- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20\n\n- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)\n\n- In Coffeescript, Javascript, Python, Ruby and Scala the English numbers are preloaded and can be accessed as:\n```\nnumbers = [\"zero\", \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\", \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", \"ten\", \"eleven\", \"twelve\",\"thirteen\", \"fourteen\", \"fifteen\", \"sixteen\", \"seventeen\", \"eighteen\", \"nineteen\", \"twenty\"]\n```\n\n- For other languages it is not preloaded and you can instead copy the above list if you desire.\n\n",
